            <p>When I started writing these articles, I intended to write one every month to
help people without Autism understand what goes on in my mind.  By exposing how my Autism
affects me, my hope is that any readers will be able to apply some small portion of what
they read in these articles to enhance their lives.  I know it won&rsquo;t be directly applicable
to someone in their own lives, as everyone with Autism manifests slightly differently, but
maybe it helps open a door even a bit. Helping to understand a loved one, encouraging a
kind word to someone with Autism in their lives, or just having them take a minute to read
and to think. To me, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what form that help takes.  It&rsquo;s that I try and
provide that spark.</p>
<p>You see, that is how I was raised.  I have a great mother who raised three children on
her own starting in the late 1970s, a time where a decision like that was not very
popular.  Over the years, we have talked about the reasons she did that, and her reason
always remained the same, just with different color: &ldquo;I love you kids, and I knew it
would be hard, but I knew I could do it.  So I did.&rdquo;  From there, it was always a solid
talk about how her faith in God as a Roman Catholic helped her in the tough times.  There
is always a mention of how we often threw roadblocks in her way, roadblocks that all
three of us blush at or laugh at when they are now mentioned.  But there is always the
firm statement from my mother that through it all, her love for us never faultered. And
in return, all us kids had one extra best friend in our lives.</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t just us that she affected.  By continuing to be involved in her church,
she was fortunate enough to meet, to fall in love with, and to marry and second love of
her life, her second husband Gerry.  She loved Gerry&rsquo;s kids as her own, and would often
speak of his kids and his grandkids with the same love that she had for her own
grandkids.  Not one to be idle, it was rare that she wasn&rsquo;t working on a sewing or
knitting.  She used her skills to make doll clothes for children in need, and baby
blankets for newborns at the local hospital.  Once again, when I asked, she said that
it kept her busy and that she was giving back to a community that had helped her when
she needed it.  So she did it.</p>
<p>It is because of this that I have started writing these articles and writing in general.
As someone with Autism, I cannot help everyone out there, but perhaps I can help get some
manner of message to some of the people, and do my bit to help.  Write the next great
science fiction novel?  Tried that and failed miserably.  Invent some new software that
will revolutionize the way we do something?  Tried that and did decently okay back in the
1990s.  Write from my heart about how my Autism affects me?  To echo what my mother said
with my own spin: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to be easy, and I know being vulnerable is hard, but
I know I can do it.  So I did.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But that bedrock of my life, my mother is now faltering.  After 75+ years of her life,
my mother is being attacked by the disease known at dementia.  It&rsquo;s effects are brutal.
From a time when I could pick up the phone and have a really good 30 minute conversation
with one of my best friends, we struggle to have a 30 second conversation that is
coherent.  From a time where we used to laugh at all the stupid things I did as a kid,
I talk with my brother and sister afterwards, holding back the tears.  From a time
when we would talk about our next family gathering with Mom and the three kids and our
families, we have started to talk about funeral plans and how we don&rsquo;t want our mother
to have the pain of losing her mind.</p>
<p>The last decent conversation I remember having with my mother is in August, right after
my son&rsquo;s birthday.  It was a bit sketchy in places, and it was obvious that some of her
long term memory was going, but it was a good conversation.  Every two or three weeks
after that, some element of the conversation dropped away.  It was if someone was taking
some of the color out of my mother&rsquo;s life, and I could hear the struggle in her voice.
It was harder to call, because I knew that when I called, it would hang over me like
a dark cloud for the next couple of days.  I started making excuses as to why I couldn&rsquo;t
call, convincing myself it was for the better.  I was just scared.  I was losing my
best friend.</p>
<p>This really hit home just after New Year&rsquo;s Day when I called her to wish her a happy
new year.  I wish I could relate to you what that conversation was about, but I honestly
don&rsquo;t have a clue.  I asked her how she was doing, and she said she was sad.  And then
she mentioned something about children and red and a couple of other things I didn&rsquo;t
understand.  Talking with my sister later, she mentioned that she must be having a good
day that I was able to get 1 or 2 coherent sentences out of her.  Most days, my sister
wasn&rsquo;t even getting that.  </p>
<p>That really threw me.  I tried writing an article about Autism for a good solid six
weeks since then, but nothing came out.  Every time I started to write, I wrote one
sentence and stared at the screen for 15 minutes before giving up.  I always went
back to thinking about Mom and her dementia.  It was then, when I started thinking about
it that I realized that this is also affecting me on another level, a more personal
level.  I was afraid for me.</p>
<p>Autism by itself is now walk in the park.  Sure, I have learned to mitigate a lot of it,
but it still a lot of work.  I was lucky to find a second wife later in life who takes
that time to understand me, reasonably asking me to understand her quirks in return. But
seeing how quickly my mother&rsquo;s dementia has removed most of the woman that I knew and
admired growing up, that&rsquo;s chilling.</p>
<p>You see, as someone with Autism, I have spent my life working on my communication skills
and overcoming a lack of social skills by using the positive aspects of my Autism to
compensate.  Back in August, when my mother&rsquo;s dementia was getting worse, I looked up
the definition of dementia on the
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013">Mayo Clinic&rsquo;s website</a>,
and it looked like it was tailor made as a nasty list for people with Autism.  Starting
with the <em>Cognitive Changes</em> part of the list, most people with Autism have problems
with the &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; items, and if they are lucky they compensate for those with the
&ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; items that they excel at.  The thought of losing some or all of my ability
to mitigate my Autism sucks.  The <em>Psychological Changes</em> part of the list isn&rsquo;t much
better.  To be truthful, I know that my Autism has caused me to experience at least
5 out of the 7 things on that list.  It is only by working hard and trusting in my
doctor and psychologist that I now keep their influence down to a bare minimum.  But
if they get worse?</p>
<p>For me, part of having Autism is being hyper-aware of things around me.  Its hard to
miss things when you brain is busy analyzing things for most of your life.  At 52
years of age, I am noticing that I am forgetting some little things here and here, mostly
short term stuff.  There are times where I have difficulty in finding the right words to
communicate something, only for the word that I am looking for to be something simple.
And as funny as it sounds, I am forgetting where I placed my keys more often these days,
something that almost never happened in the past.  And with what my mother is going
through, I sometimes wonder if I am getting some early tinges of dementia, or if this
is just normal&hellip; or at least as normal as a person with Autism can get.</p>
<p>But I am not one to wallow, I am one to get out there and do stuff.  I know I get knocked
down from time to time, but I also know that I am not alone.  My family, in their own
unique ways, helps to give me the courage to dust myself off and stand up again.</p>
<p>Am I worred about my mother?  Yes.  But the only thing I can do there is to try and call
her to let her know I am here, and to send peaceful thought her way.</p>
<p>Am I still worried that the same thing that is afflicting my mother will one day afflict
me?  Yes.  But I hopefully have some time before that happens, I can look for positive
things to do that can help me fend it off.</p>
<p>Does my writing help me as much as it helps others?  Yes.  For me, I think that my
writing helps me as much as others by acting like my own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a>.
It hurts to talk about things sometimes, but if I can help one person in some way, it
is good enought for me.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
