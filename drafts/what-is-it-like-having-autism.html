<p>Over the course of my lifetime, I have surprised a number of people by revealing that I have
Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome or Autism.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like you have Autism?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that just
mean you are a computer geek?&rdquo; are the two most frequent responses I get.  It&rsquo;s not really that
simple.  </p>
<p>Autism&rsquo;s full name is Autism Spectrum Disorder, and embraces a whole lot of different people.
To be clear, I have Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome, and as of my last psychologist&rsquo;s visit, I am still on
&ldquo;the spectrum&rdquo;.  As of a couple of years ago, Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome has been rolled under the
Autism Spectrum Disorder umbrella as a highly functioning form of Autism.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder">What Is Autism Spectrum Disorder?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>First off, what is Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD, or Autism?  The best entry-level description
I found was at <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/autism">vocabulary.com</a> which was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Autism is a neurological condition that&rsquo;s marked by differences in learning styles, passionate interests in specific subjects, repetitive motion, and sometimes difficulty with language and communication. &hellip; Because autistic people may display a wide variety of characteristics, autism is defined as a range of conditions, known as the autism spectrum. This spectrum varies from those who have a hard time with social interaction to people who aren&rsquo;t able to speak</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because people with Autism have a different neurology than typical people, the term
&ldquo;neuroatypical&rdquo; was used for a long time to distinguish those with Autism from those
without Autism.  The problem with that usage is that it also has come to also mean people with
mental and behavioral disorder, including mood, anxiety, dissociative, psychotic, personality,
and eating disorders.  While many of these have a negative connotation, they do share an
underlying difference from the normal or typical way of thinking, and as such, is appropriate.<sup id="fnref:neurotypical"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:neurotypical">1</a></sup></p>
<p>All of the big words aside, people with ASD think differently.  Any medications that may
work to help people with ASD will help treat some of the side effects of having ASD, such
as mood or anxiety disorders, but not the ASD itself.  There is no cure for ASD, and there is
no pill that will make it easier to live with.</p>
<p>For an individual with ASD to deal with, or mitigate, some of the symptoms of ASD, it is only
through hard work that it can be achieved.  That hard work is always gain through much trial
and error, and for it to work consistently, that hard work must be continuously applied when
needed.</p>
<p>The unfortunate part?  Whatever the mitigation is, it usually only works for a narrow
band of circumstances.  And people with ASD will often takes &ldquo;what works&rdquo; and apply it to
a new situation with disastrous effects, not understanding why a situation is different.  To
understand why, we have to look at some of the signs.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-some-of-the-signs">What Are Some of the Signs?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-some-of-the-signs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While these signs are not 100% true of every person with ASD, they are usually true to
various extents.  Also note that people with ASD who have a lot of mitigations in place can
often not appear to have these symptoms, when they actual do.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism</p>
<p>What might be difficult for a person with autism?
to enjoy artistic activities such as drawing or painting
to engage in physical activities such as running
to do routine chores around the household
to hold a meaningful conversation with a classmate</p>
<p>develop verbal, physical, social, and intellectual skills at a specific pace, in a particular order, and at a particular level
enjoy and function well in complex social settings with large numbers of people
have little or no difficulty in managing sensory &ldquo;assaults&rdquo; ranging from chemicals in the air to a barrage of intense light, sound, crowds, and movement
find it pleasant and easy to engage in team activities including sports, games, and projects
learn best in a fast-paced, highly verbal, competitive setting with large numbers of same-aged peers
perform well under pressure
speak, move, and behave in &ldquo;expected&rdquo; ways (at an expected volume, pace, distance from others, etc.)
have an expected set of interests and passions (usually sports, movies, popular music, food, etc.)</p>
<p>There are many similarities in autism and Asperger syndrome, also known as Asperger’s disorder. Both autism and Asperger’s disorder are known as &ldquo;Autism Spectrum Disorders&rdquo;. People who have autism and Asperger’s disorder both suffer from poor communication skills. Even though the person who has Asperger’s may have great expressive language skills, he or she will have problems communicating due to trouble interpreting other people’s social cues. Therefore, both have trouble maintaining age appropriate relationships. Many children with high functioning autism or Asperger’s disorder would rather talk to adults than kids their own age. Poor eye contact is exhibited by both populations. Resistance to a change in routine is commonly found in both Asperger’s and autism. Hyper or hyposensitivity to pain and touch is common in both disorders. Problems with gross and fine motor skills can be noted in both groups. Children with autism and Asperger syndrome alike may develop obsessions to a specific subject of interest.</p>
<p>While there are many similarities between children with autism and those with Asperger’s disorder, there are also quite a few differences that can be noted. Verbal IQ is higher than the performance IQ in Asperger’s. Young children with Asperger’s disorder reach most developmental milestones within a typical timeframe. Normal to above average intelligence and language development is common in children with Asperger’s disorder. In autism, the person’s IQ is usually below average, and communication delays are always present. Many autistic children are very late at developing verbal language. Some are nonverbal. Asperger’s is usually detected later in a child’s life than autism. The average age for the diagnosis of Asperger’s is 6-11, and Autism is usually diagnosed around or before the age of 3. Problems with depression are much more common with people who have Asperger’s disorder than in those with autism. This is probably because those with Asperger’s disorder tend to know that they have social challenges and sometimes suffer anxiety and depression related to these problems, while autistic people typically are to some degree oblivious to the need for social interactions.</p>
