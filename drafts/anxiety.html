            <p>Will anyone read my articles?  Will anyone understand what I am trying to say with those
articles?  What will people think when they read my articles?  These are normal feelings
for a normal person to feel when they write an article.  Did I say the right things?  Did I
talk too much or too litle?  Did they laugh at what I said because they thought I was
&ldquo;ha-ha&rdquo; funny or &ldquo;weird&rdquo; funny?  Those are normal feelings for a normal person to feel when
they have a conversation with someone else.  Do I contribute my share of the work to my
team at work?  Do I help my team work through issues more efficiently, or am I constantly
slowing them down?  When my team needs me, am I there to help?  Those are normal feelings
for a normal person to feel about their workplace.</p>
<p>Think about the writing articles with barely any intuitive understanding of how
people respond, only understanding gained from hard fought experinece.  Imagine trying to
have a conversation without having any decent grasp on the social cues that most people
use to guide their conversations in the right direction.  Consider the difficulties others
have in trying to navigate the meandering stream that is your team, your workplace, your
culture.  Now thinking about those three difficulties overlapping and happening at the
same time.</p>
<p>That is an oversimplification of how people with Autism feel a lot of the time, but I feel
that those descriptions start to encompass the difficulties that we face every day.
Trying to talk to others about how you think and feel is a daunting task for anyone.  But
add another level of difficulty on to that conversation because you know that you think
differently than most people.  That is why a lot of people with Autism, people that
want to try and fit in, choose not to disclose their Autism to those around them.
I guess most of the time people decide the pain of hiding who they truly are is less
painful than talking about how different they are than others.  I know I kept on
making that exact decision for myself for years before I decided no more.</p>
<p>And that decision itself causes negative consequences downstream from that decision.
As this article from
<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/autism/autism-and-the-workforce">Psychology Today</a>
states, 20 percent of people are unemployed and only 58 percent of people that are adults
under 25 work for pay.  These aren&rsquo;t the first time I have heard numbers like these. And,
as the article states when quoting those numbers, other estimates are much higher.  Imagine
sitting in an interview room trying to form that bond with the hiring manager when it is
hard for you to establish connections with other people and is incredibly difficult to
look your interviewer in the eye when talking.  Even if you make it though the interview
process, you know you are going to be constantly trying to understand the social dynamics
of that workplace.  That is a tiring job for someone with Autism, whether that person is
successful or not.</p>
<p>Even if you find the courage to decide to disclose to others that you have Autism, many of
those problems do not go away.  If the interviewer does not understand Autism, they might
evaluate your interview like a normal person.  That never goes well.  While I don&rsquo;t
blame them, quite a few of my interviews ended with a &ldquo;we think you are a technical fit,
but I don&rsquo;t think you fit into our company culture&rdquo;.  And hopefully your hiring manager
is present at a successful interview so you can also interview them.  If not, you end up
in a situation where you don&rsquo;t know how they will react to your Autism.  Even worse,
you meet the hiring manager and they get reorganized within your company, and you end
up working for someone who couldn&rsquo;t care less about you having Autism.  That sucks.</p>
<p>If you are incredibly lucky, your team&rsquo;s management understands that you are
different, but they need to be educated on how &ldquo;you&rdquo; are different.  From personal
experience, this is a good position to be in.  But even in that position, I worry that I
take up too much of their time with things that they consider to be trivial.  You see, I
do not intuitively know what is trivial to them, just what I have observed and learned
from past conversations with them.  Rarely is there any intuitive component to that
learning, so I have had many conversations with both people that started with words like
&ldquo;I remember you said&rdquo;, had words like &ldquo;I interpretted that to mean&rdquo; in the middle, and
words like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and understand better next time&rdquo; at the end.  I do understand that
happens to everyone, but I have no clue on what a good or bad level of that happening is.</p>
<p>And even those things are not the worst parts of how it feels like to be someone with
Autism.  For a lot of people with Autism, there is the anxiety.  For me, that anxiety
is fueled by my ability to analyze.</p>
<p>If you know someone with Autism that is doing better than average, chances are they are
able to mitigate some of the issues that come with Autism with some of the positive ones.
For me, the big positive [thing] that comes with my Autism is my ability to analyze things.
In my professional job as a Software Development Engineer in Test (or SDET for short),
being able to analyze the applications that I write test automation for is a very big
asset.  Without spending too much energy, I can quickly digest either source code or
documentation for a project and understand it without too much effort.  As I go, I form
a list of questions that help me clarify my understanding, sometimes down to a very fine
degree of understanding.  Using all that information together, I can quickly generate an
analysis of that project&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, providing risk/impact/benefit
assessments.  I can then take those assessments and generate a solid plan on how to
mitigate those tests with manual testing and test automation, providing ideas on how
to measure the efficiency and coverage of those tests to my management.</p>
<p>And yes, I do a great job and it contains tasks that I am very well suited to executing.
But it is something I cannot turn off.  I can lose myself temporarily in things like my
writing, my music, and my movies.  But when those are not there, my mind starts swirling
again trying
to analyze everything around me.  And it is not only the current things that my mind
analyzes, but things that have occured in the past couple of weeks.  I will be out walking
our dog when I start to think about all sorts of things, unable to just enjoy walking our
dog.  To be clear, it is not our dog&rsquo;s fault that I don&rsquo;t enjoy the walks, it is mine.
I just cannot stop my mind from racing around like a hamster on drugs trying to run a
four minute mile in three minutes.</p>
<p>With that level of analysis going on all the time, anxiety is not far behind.  Let me
go back to one of the examples that I used at the beginning of the article, a simple
conversation.  If I am having that conversation on the phone, I tend to do okay because
everyone has the same level of not understanding other people without the context of
actually seeing them.  I am still analyzing everything I am saying and I am hearing, but
the amount of data I have to work with is relatively small.  My personal experience is
that other people that are good at communicating acknowledge that the data stream of
a phone call is limited, providing extra information to try and help fill in those gaps.
But I still struggle.</p>
<p>The next level up are video calls and team meetings over video platforms. For me, that
increase in data is often more confusing than helpful, so I often hide as many of the
video windows as possible.  Without thinking about it, my mind tries to analyze the
backgrounds of everyone on the call, analyzing how they are responding to the conversation,
and how their (confusing) body language is or is not agreeing with what they are saying.
This is not something that I can shut off, it just happens.  On normal days and good days
I can expend some mental effort to push that analysis into the background, but it does
cost me energy to do so.  And the bad days?  I try and get through the meetings with my
eyes closed as much as possible.</p>
<p>In person meetings are another level up, with more data to process and analyze.  And the
worst?  Group meetings.  The more people in the meeting, the worse off it is for me. Once
again, I can expend energy to push some of the analysis into the background, but it always
costs me.  I have learned some tricks over the years to focus on a smaller set of things
in those meetings, and that helps.  But any meetings with more then three people generally
tire me out immensely.  And if I am in a large group of people, especially people that
are all moving or talking at once, all bets are off.</p>
<p>So how does all of this relate to anxiety?  For me, as those different scenarios are
playing out in real life, my mind is racing to analyze that stream of data as I am living
through it.  Sometimes it feels like I continuously have a set of sports announcers in my
head giving me a critique, questioning every word that I uttered and every expression and
micro-expression that I emoted. Was I looking at the right places during the
conversation?  Did I maintain enough eye contact, or should I add some more in for good
measure?  Did I now just add to much eye contact, so I am staring at them like a creep?
Ooh, they are wearing a nice piece of jewelry that sparkles.  Crap, I looked at the bright
shiny thing instead of where I should be looking.  Did they notice?  Even worse, did they
notice that I looked there and think I am checking them out?  They just crossed their
arms. What does that mean for them?</p>
<p>That level of noise coming from your own brain is hard to drown out.  And without the
tools that a lot of other people have at their disposal to answer those questions, I
am left with the bulk of those questions left unanswered.  I am not even sure which of
those questions it is socially acceptable to ask people at the various levels of
friendship or professionalism that they have with me. [more?]</p>
<p>I am sure that I am not the only person with anxiety on this planet, but a lot of the time
it feels like I am worse off with my anxiety than other people.  I mean, I have been
diagnosed with Autism with an anxiety disorder, so that must be some indication of how bad
it is, right?</p>
<p>But, as with most things in life, I have a choice.
[show how I am positively][1-2 paras at most]</p>
<p>And that is why every day I choose to wake up and be as positive as I can be. Even on the
bad days where I seem to feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.</p>
<p>You see, if I don&rsquo;t push back against my own anxiety, no one else will.  It&rsquo;s all up to me.</p>
