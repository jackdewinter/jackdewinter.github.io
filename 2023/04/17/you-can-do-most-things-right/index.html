            <p>When my kids were growing up, I tried to install in them some of the wisdom in them that
my mother gave to me.  Certain things stuck and other things, not so much.  But when
it comes down to it, all I can hope for is that between things I stressed and things
that they learn, that they will get to a good point in their lives a lot quicker
than I did.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial people in my life was my mother.  Now that she is no longer
in my life, I find myself reflecting on all the kindness and understanding that
she was able to give to the people around her.  It was my mother who first told
me &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many times you get knocked down, as long as you get up
each time!&rdquo;  I thought it was a silly saying at the time, only to give her a big
hug in my forties and let her know how much that helped me.</p>
<p>Software development is a part of life, and that saying is something that I think
about each day when I am working on the computer. It is a rare day when I do not
make a handful of mistakes, each one of them requiring me to check my ego at the
door, figure out what went wrong, dust myself off, and stand up again.  But today,
I was greeted with one of these scenarios where I was least expecting it&hellip; in the
recent release of the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project.</p>
<p>This scenario is one that can happen with interpreted languages and is a splendid
example of why code coverage is great for interpreted languages.  On the weekend,
I wrapped up the work I was doing on the project, and double checked everything.
With everything looking good, I used my <code>package.cmd</code> script to create the new
<code>v0.9.10</code> package so that I could run it through my pre-release tests.  The tests
themselves are not extensive tests, but tests to ensure that at least eighty percent
of the code is working properly.  Simple things like testing out the subcommands
and scanning a set of curated Markdown documents to make sure things work.  These
tests are meant to catch the odd case where things were missed, which does happen
from time to time.</p>
<p>In this case, the scenario slipped through the cracks.  As Python is interpreted,
you must interpret a given line to test whether it works properly.  In this
case, I had made a change to my <code>application-properties</code> package to expose
new functionality that PyMarkdown needed: default configuration files. Over in
that project, I made the changes and bumped the version to <code>0.6.0</code>.  In the PyMarkdown
project, I used <code>pipenv</code> to make the equivalent change to the project.  When I
was ready for the release, I ran my normal tests, and everything passed.</p>
<p>The problem was that I did not update the project&rsquo;s <code>install-requirements.txt</code>
file that details the project&rsquo;s non-developmental dependencies.  In this case,
my release testing did not have simple tests that involved the changed interface,
so it passed without issue.</p>
<p>So now I need to pick myself back up and start to figure out how to solve
that issue.  It must be a test that is quick to execute, and a test that is not
just a repeat of the scenario tests.  Those are detailed tests that dig down
into the core of the project.  I just need something that will help me identify
issues with dependencies.  Not sure yet what it will be, but I hope to talk about
it next time.  Stay tuned!</p>
