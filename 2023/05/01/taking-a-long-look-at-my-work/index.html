            <p>It is not an understatement to say that a lot of my professional and personal
software development revolves around doing things smarter, not working harder.
While I joke that I am being lazy&hellip; er&hellip; efficient, it is just a standard
point of view that I believe I have.  I would prefer to do things once or have
things done once and iterate on that.</p>
<p>Starting from square one is not always the right answer.  It took me about twenty
years of my career to figure that out, but I did get there eventually.  With everything
that you do, there is a balance to be struck between cost, benefit, and impact.
While there are professional &ldquo;things&rdquo; that are easy to associate with those three
concepts, I started to realize that the personal version of those &ldquo;things&rdquo; was
even more costly.</p>
<p>Let me use cost as an example.  From a business point of view, the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; in question
can mainly be broken down into two categories: resource cost and opportunity cost.
Resource cost is an easy one to calculate.  How many people does it take and at what
price point to complete the task?  The tricky part here is that most teams do not
carefully consider maintenance and bugs fixes as an upfront cost, and instead
deal with them as they show up.  The infrastructure and other resources that the
team needs to stand up their work is also a resource cost.  With billing in place
in professional settings, which is an easy cost to measure.</p>
<p>Opportunity cost is a bit more difficult to measure, but one that management battles
with all the time.  In its simplest form, this is the cost of not doing something.
As an example, say there are three features you can work on, Feature A, Feature B,
and Feature C.  Then assume you can only work on one of those features.  There are
also customers lined up to pay for a product that contains each of the three features.
That means that the cost of working on Feature A is perhaps not getting the customers
for Features B and C to use the product.  And if you can get them to use the application,
it is usually with a contract promise that their feature will be completed by a
given date.  From there, it often snowballs.</p>
<p>Whether it be personal time software development or personal life issues, similar
costs apply.  When I look at the next feature or issue to address in any of my projects,
I must think about the amount of effort it will take and what I will not be able to
add to my other projects because of it.  Even more importantly, there are the personal
life issue costs.</p>
<p>As a dyed-in-the-wool geek, I would love to be able to do stuff like software development
all day, every day&hellip; but I just do not have it in me anymore.  I love the creative
process of writing open-source software, but there are real-life costs that must
be paid to make that creative freedom occur.  A good example was this weekend. I
have been putting off cleaning up the garage for a couple of weeks, so I finally
decided the opportunity cost of not having it done was getting too high.  That and
the cost of me swearing at the work needed to clean up the garage was just getting
annoying.  So, it got to a point where the cost was one worth paying.</p>
<p>But there is also a hidden cost about not taking time to appreciate the world around
you and to ground yourself in that world.  As lazy as it sounds, I took time
to sit outside this weekend and just relax working on a handful of crossword puzzles. It
was just something very low-key and somewhat boring, but it was relaxing.  Listening
to our dog snore, the bird chirping, and getting fresh air helped me connect with
the world in a small way.  Then later when I was working on open-source
projects, I was able to focus on those projects with a clearer head because I took
the time to recharge in that uncomplicated way.</p>
<p>How does this come back to my open-source work?  I have lately been just taking
time to look at the projects and see if there is any low-cost refactoring
that I can do to make those projects better.  Nothing spectacular, but better.
Keeping in mind that everything must have a balance, I just want to note down
a list of things that I can work on in the next few months to make my own personal
effort more efficient.  And I believe that is a good cost for me to figure out
every so often.</p>
