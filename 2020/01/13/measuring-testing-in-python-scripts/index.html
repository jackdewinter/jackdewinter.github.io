<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As part of the process of
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/12/08/markdown-linter-collecting-requirements/">creating a Markdown Linter</a>
to use with my personal website, I firmly believe that it is imperative that I have
solid testing on that linter and the tools necessary to test the linter.  In my
previous article on
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/01/06/scenario-testing-python-scripts/">Scenario Testing Python Scripts</a>,
I described the in-process framework that I use for testing Python scripts from within
PyTest.  That framework ensures that I can properly test Python scripts from the
start of the script, increasing my confidence that they are tested properly.</p>
<p>To properly figure out how my tests are doing and what their impact is, I turned on a
number of features that are available with PyTest.  The features either make testing
easier or measure the impact of those tests and relay that information. This article
describes my PyTest configuration and how that configuration provides a benefit to my
development process.</p>
<h2 id="adding-needed-packages-to-pytest">Adding Needed Packages to PyTest<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-needed-packages-to-pytest" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are four main Python packages that I use in conjunction with PyTest.  The
<code>pytest-console-scripts</code> package is the main one, allowing PyTest to be invoked
from the command line.  Since I am in favor of automating process where possible, this
is a necessity.  From a test execution point of view, the <code>pytest-timeout</code> is
used to set a timeout on each test, ensuring that a single runaway test does not cause
the set of tests to fail to complete.  For reporting, the <code>pytest-html</code> package is
useful for creating an HTML summary of the test results.  The <code>pytest-cov</code> package adds
coverage of the source code, with reporting of that coverage built in.  I have found
that all of these packages help me in my development of Python scripts, so I highly
recommend these packages.</p>
<p>Depending on the Python package manager and environment in use, there will be slightly
different methods to install these packages.  For plain Python this is usually:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install pytest-console-scripts<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">0</span>.20 pytest-cov<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">2</span>.8.1 pytest-timeout<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">1</span>.3.3 pytest-html<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">2</span>.0.1
</pre></div>
<p>As I have used <code>pipenv</code> a lot in my professional Python development, all of my personal
projects use it for setting up the environment and it’s dependencies.  Similar to the
line above, to install these packages into <code>pipenv</code> requires executing the following
line in the project’s directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv install pytest-console-scripts<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">0</span>.20 pytest-cov<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">2</span>.8.1 pytest-timeout<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">1</span>.3.3 pytest-html<span class="o">==</span><span class="m">2</span>.0.1
</pre></div>
<h2 id="configuring-pytest-for-those-packages">Configuring PyTest For Those Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-pytest-for-those-packages" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless information is provided on the command line, PyTest will search for a
configuration file to use.  By default, <code>setup.cfg</code> is the name of the configuration
file it uses.  The following fragment of my <code>setup.cfg</code> file takes care of the
configuration for those PyTest packages.  </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[tool:pytest]
testpaths=./test
cache_dir=./build/test/.pytest_cache
junit_family=xunit2
addopts=--timeout=10 --cov --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=90 --strict-markers -ra --cov-report xml:report/coverage.xml --cov-report html:report/coverage --junitxml=report/tests.xml --html=report/report.html
</pre></div>
<p>While all configuration is important, the following sections are most important in the
setting up of PyTest for measuring the effects of testing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>testpaths=./test</code> - relative path where PyTest will scan for tests</li>
<li><code>addopts/--junitxml</code> - creates a junit-xml style report file at given path</li>
<li><code>addopts/--cov</code> - record coverage information for everything</li>
<li><code>addopts/--cov-branch</code> - enables branch coverage</li>
<li><code>addopts/--cov-report</code> - types of report to generate and their destination paths</li>
<li><code>default/--cov-config</code> - configuration file for coverage, defaulting to <code>.coveragerc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order, the first two configuration items tells PyTest where to look for tests to
execute and where to place the JUnit-styled XML report with the results of each test.
The next three configuration items turn on coverage collection, enable
branch coverage, and specifies what types of coverage reports to produce and where to
place them.  Finally, because the <code>--cov-config</code> is not set, the default location for
the coverage configuration file is set to <code>.coveragerc</code>.  </p>
<p>For all of my projects, the default <code>.coveragerc</code> that I use, with a small change to
the <code>source=</code> line is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[run]
source = pyscan

[report]
exclude_lines =
    # Have to re-enable the standard pragma
    pragma: no cover

    # Don't complain about missing debug-only code:
    def __repr__
    if self\.debug

    # Don't complain if tests don't hit defensive assertion code:
    raise AssertionError
    raise NotImplementedError

    # Don't complain if non-runnable code isn't run:
    if 0:
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
</pre></div>
<p>To be honest, this <code>.coveragerc</code> template is something I picked up somewhere, but it
works, and works well for my needs.  The exclude lines work in all case that I have
come across, so I haven’t touched them in the 2+ years that I have been writing code in
Python.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-this-configuration">Benefits Of This Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-this-configuration" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the setup from the last section, there are two main benefits that I get from this
setup.  The first benefit is machine readable XML information generated for the test
results and the test coverage.  While this is not immediately consumable in it’s
current form, that data can be harvested in the future to provide concise information
about what has been tested.</p>
<p>The second benefit is to provide human readable information about the tests that have
been executed.  The HTML file located at <code>report/report.html</code> relays the results of the
last series of tests while the HTML file located at <code>report/coverage/index.html</code> relays
the coverage information for the last series of tests.  Both of these pieces of
information are useful for different reasons.</p>
<p>In the case of the test results HTML, the information presented on the test results page
is mostly the same information as is displayed by PyTest when executed on the command
line.  Some useful changes are present, such as seeing all of the test information at
once, instead of just a <code>.</code> for a successful test, a <code>F</code> for a failed test, and so on.
I have found that having this information available on one page allows me to more
quickly debug an issue that is affecting multiple tests, instead of scrolling through
the command line output one test at a time.</p>
<p>In the case of the test coverage HTML, the information presented on this page is
invaluable.  For each source file in the Python project being tested, there is a page
that clearly shows which lines of each Python script are exercised by the tests,  By
using these pages as a guide, I can determine what tests I need to add to ensure that
the scripts are properly covered.</p>
<p>By using these two tools together, I can quickly determine what tests to add, and when
tests fail, I can determine why they failed and look for patterns in the failures.  This
enables me to quickly figure out where the blind spots are in my testing, and to address
them quickly.  This in turn can help me to figure out the best way to improve the
quality of the project I am working on.</p>
<p>If this finds an issue with an existing requirement, that requirement can be adjusted
or a new requirement added to fulfil the deficiency.  If the requirements were all
right and the code it was testing was incorrect, that code can be addressed.  If
the coverage page shows that code was written but not tested, a new test function can
be introduced to cover that scenario.  Each observation and its appropriate action
work to improve the quality of the software project.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-accomplished">What Was Accomplished<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-accomplished" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This article showed how to setup PyTest using a configuration file.  With that
configuration file, it was set up to provide timeouts for tests, provide output on
the test results, and provide a coverage report of how well the tests covered the
scripts under test.  This was all accomplished to better understand the impact of tests
on a project and provide better information on how they succeed (test coverage) or fail
(test results).  By understanding this information, the quality of the software
can be measured and improved on if needed.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What Is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the next article, I will briefly describe the PyScan tool I have written, and how it
takes the XML information generate by the <code>--junitxml=report/tests.xml</code> option and the
<code>--cov-report xml:report/coverage.xml</code> option and produces concise summaries of that
information.  I will also give a number of examples of how I use this information during
my development of Python projects.</p>
