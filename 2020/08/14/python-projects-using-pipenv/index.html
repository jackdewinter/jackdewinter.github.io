<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With almost a year of Python development under my belt, I wanted to start talking about
the Python elements that I feel have made my development of the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown project</a>
successful.  When thinking about where to start, the first thing that came to mind was
my use of PipEnv to maintain the project environment.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I am relatively new to Python, I am an old hat at trying to maintain a cohesive
way to keep my projects usable yet portable.  From my early days in C and Pascal to my
current days in Go and Java, I have always tried to have a cohesive story around how to
package my project’s source code to be used by multiple developers.  In the end, I
found that the main goals were always the same: how do I keep a project usable by all
interested developers, while keeping the maintenance of that project to a minimum?</p>
<p>From my point of view,
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">PipEnv</a>
meets those goals for Python by solving a lot of the common issues that project
maintainers and developers have.  This in turn makes two of the harder parts of
developing programs mostly disappear: dependency management and portability.  Using the
simple command <code>pip install --user pipenv</code> to install into any Python system, PipEnv quickly became a useful tool in my toolbox and has stayed there.
During this article, I will talk about why PipEnv keeps that position in my toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="quick-note">Quick Note<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-note" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I realize some projects may still be on Python version 2, this article is
targeted for people developing on Python 3 and above.  More precisely, these examples
were all tested with Python 3.7.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pipenv">What Is PipEnv?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-pipenv" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While the full answer can be seen at the top of the
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">PipEnv home page</a>,
my summary of that answer is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PipEnv is a Python module that cleanly manages your Python project and its dependencies, ensuring that the project can be easily rebuilt on other systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that might seem like an easy thing to accomplish, PipEnv or tools like it are
usually only employed after a journey through other, less efficient solutions.</p>
<p>To understand those solutions and the problems that they present, let’s start at
the beginning with dependency management.</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-dependencies">Starting with Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-dependencies" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Python, as with most modern languages, a lot of the heavy lifting is done in
libraries.  For Python, these libraries must be installed directly into the current
instance of Python for those libraries to be visible to the Python programs.  The most
common way of installing and managing those libraries locally is to use the
<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/"><code>pip</code></a>
tool. For example, to add the latest version of the <code>colorama</code> library to the local
Python installation, the following command is used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install colorama
</pre></div>
<p>But that command has a problem in that it installs the specified library into the global
instance of Python.  Even addressing that problem using a user-specific variation of
that command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install --user colorama
</pre></div>
<p>that caching still takes effect for all Python programs that are run as that user.
That is a bit better, but not optimal.</p>
<p>The big issue is that it is hard to replicate which libraries are installed for any given project without maintaining a per-project
script with many lines in it, one for each library. With multiple projects sharing the
same global cache of libraries, a clear way to enforce the libraries and versions
needed for a specific project is needed.</p>
<p>Enter the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="explicitly-specifying-requirements-as-code">Explicitly Specifying Requirements as Code<a class="headerlink" href="#explicitly-specifying-requirements-as-code" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step that many people take on their Python project journey is to create a
<code>requirements.txt</code> file to hold all the library requirements for their project. The
file has a format of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>colorama=0.4.3
Pygments==2.4.2
</pre></div>
<p>with each library being listed on its own line, optionally followed by the version
of the library to install. To apply these library requirements to a given Python
environment, the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install --user -r requirements.txt
</pre></div>
<p>is used.  This usage of <code>pip</code> is used as a shortcut for having to call <code>pip install</code>
once for every library needed in the project.  By
this point in the project process, most developers understand that nailing down a
specific version of the library being used is critical to the project’s success.  By
specifying an exact version of the library to be referenced, the <code>pip</code> tool guarantees
that it will always reference that specific version of the library, locking down the
behavior of the library and making it predictable.</p>
<p>While the tool usage is simple enough, there are problems with using the <code>pip</code> tool
in this way.  The first problem is that to ensure that I have the right libraries for
my program, every time I run that program, I need to re-run that
<code>pip install --user -r requirements.txt</code> command before I run my program.  If I do not
run that command, I risk the chance that another program has changed
the libraries on my program, either causing the program to fail or rendering its output
questionable.  Even when I created a script to run the above command and my program
together, I felt that the combination often feels slow, bothersome, and inelegant.</p>
<p>The second problem is that of “phantom” dependencies.  For argument’s sake, let’s assume
that I am maintaining 2 projects and their dependencies.  Project A has a dependency
on Library 1 and Project B has a dependency on Library 2, with Library 1 and
Library 2 being separate libraries.  Furthermore, let’s assume that both
projects use a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and the above <code>pipenv install</code> method to manage
their project
dependencies.  Because of the way these files are applied, if Project B is used after
Project A, it retains access to Library 1 that was installed by Project A.  After
all, with nothing to remove Project A’s dependencies, they stay in the user’s global
cache of libraries.  This means Project B’s dependencies are not clearly defined and
may prove difficult to replicate on someone else’s machine.</p>
<p>Given those problems, how can the project move away from using global library caches?</p>
<h3 id="another-step-forward-virtual-environments">Another Step Forward: Virtual Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#another-step-forward-virtual-environments" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next step forward is to use the tools accumulated so far and to add virtual
environments into that group of tools.  Installed using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install --user virtualenv
</pre></div>
<p>the user can then run the following command to create a virtual environment under the
current directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>virtualenv venv
</pre></div>
<p>This command may take some time to complete, but once it is done, there will be a local
<code>virtualenv</code> directory that contains a completely distinct version of the Python
installation that it was created from.</p>
<p>Even with that environment in place, there is some work to do before executing the
project’s Python program.  To use the virtual environment, the execution of an
activator script is
required to set the shell’s environment to point at the correct environment.
Located in either the
<code>virtualenv\Scripts</code> directory (on Windows systems) or the <code>virtualenv\bin</code> directory
(on Posix systems) are a group of scripts with the name <code>activate</code> or matching the
pattern <code>activate.*</code>.  Executing the correct script activates the virtual environment
for a given shell, isolating any changes to the Python environment into that
virtual environment.</p>
<p>The usage of this tool seems beneficial so far, so what are the issues with this tool?
The
big issue for me is that you must remember to deactivate the environment before
leaving the project folder.  If you do not deactivate the environment before leaving the
project’s directories, you can be doing something else in another directory and forget
the directory that you anchored that environment to .  Without noticing it, a simple
<code>pip install</code> command will then alter the requirements of that environment, and not of
the environment in the current directory.   This is a realistic scenario.  In my early
days of Python development, I did this numerous times!  And each time, it took a while to
figure out what I had done and how to reverse it.</p>
<p>A smaller issue with these environments is that they are specific to the local system
but are anchored within the project.  This means that when dealing with version control
systems such as Git, the project needs to explicitly ignore the files in the project’s
<code>virtualenv</code> directory to prevent local environment files from being committed.
However, even with that directory ignored, the project requires extra scripts as part
of its project code that specify how developers need to create the required virtual
environment.</p>
<p>Given those issues, how do we take the best parts of <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code> and merge
them together?</p>
<h3 id="enter-pipenv">Enter PipEnv<a class="headerlink" href="#enter-pipenv" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Installed using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
<p><code>PipEnv</code> combines the best aspects of the previous concepts while getting rid of a fair
number of the problems.  To illustrate this, I created a sample project from scratch to
say, “Hello world!”  Setting up the project was easy.  I created a new directory,
changed my current directory to that directory, and entered the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv --three
</pre></div>
<p>It took a while for the command to complete, but upon its completion I had a directory
that contained the file <code>Pipfile</code> and a “hidden”<sup id="fnref:hidden"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hidden">1</a></sup> virtual environment.  To see
the location of that virtual environment, I entered the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv --venv
</pre></div>
<p>and PipEnv returned the path to the virtual environment.  To be specific, it created
a virtual environment that was not in my project directory, but in my local system’s
user space. This meant that the virtual environment directory did not show up in any
scans of the project directory, meaning that I did not have to ignore that directory
by any version control systems.  That was definitely a win!</p>
<p>From there, I decided I wanted to add a splash of color to the program, brightening up
a normally dull Hello World program.  While a simple Hello World program would look
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello World!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I decided to go with using the <code>colorama</code> library to add that color.  Installing the
<code>colorama</code> library to the current project was easy, using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv install colorama
</pre></div>
<p>That command looked for the latest version of the <code>colorama</code> library, installed it in
the virtual environment, updated the <code>Pipfile</code> and generated a new <code>Pipfile.lock</code> file.
Once that was completed, I created the file <code>main.py</code> with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">colorama</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">init</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Fore</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Back</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Style</span>

<span class="n">init</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Fore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">BLACK</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Back</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">GREEN</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"World!"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">Style</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">RESET_ALL</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and saved that file.  After a quick check for spelling and grammar mistakes, I executed
that program with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run python main.py
</pre></div>
<p>and I was greeted with this response:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/project-1/hello_world.png"/></p>
<p>To be clear, with 3 commands and 3 lines of Python code, I was able to create a simple
program that referenced a library to colorize the output for my simple program and to
write a single line of text to the console.  An even bigger win for me was that I knew
that if I needed this project to be portable, I could easily bundle up the source in
the directory and recreate the project elsewhere.  Having used PipEnv for months, this
was not a theory for me, this was something that I have done in practice multiple times.</p>
<p>But unless you have performed that action, it may be hard to appreciate.  So let’s
prove it!</p>
<h3 id="proving-that-the-project-really-is-portable">Proving That the Project Really Is Portable<a class="headerlink" href="#proving-that-the-project-really-is-portable" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To prove that the project is portable, I created a separate directory and copied the
contents of my sample directory into that directory.  While that is not exactly what
happens when I clone a project from Git, I believe it is a close enough estimate for
the purpose of this example.  To be specific, there were only 3 files in the source
directory for my sample project, and all of them were copied over: <code>main.py</code>,
<code>Pipfile</code>, and <code>Pipfile.lock</code>.</p>
<p>To properly setup the project, I entered the directory and executed the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv sync
</pre></div>
<p>After a while, control returned to my shell, with the <code>pipenv</code> output clearly detailing
that it created a new virtual environment and downloaded the needed libraries.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/project-1/sync.png"/></p>
<p>From there, entering the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run python main.py
</pre></div>
<p>yielded the same output as the example project in the original directory.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/project-1/hello_world.png"/> <sup id="fnref:myWord"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:myWord">2</a></sup></p>
<p>While the
typical project will be more complicated than this small project, the underlying
principles are the same.  If a project uses PipEnv to manage library dependencies,
the <code>Pipfile</code> and <code>Pipfile.lock</code> files become part of the project’s source and
allows the project’s dependencies to be replicated in another directory or on another
system.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the portability test passing, and not wanting to be a bad consumer of
system resources, I then used the following command to remove the virtual environment
from my local machine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv --rm
</pre></div>
<p>By using the <code>pipenv --venv</code> command both before and after this command, I was
able to verify that the directory containing the virtual environment was removed from
my local system.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-like-it">Why Do I Like It?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-i-like-it" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I like using PipEnv because it is simple to setup, simple to maintain, and easy to
use.  I am lazy in that I want to have the right tools at my fingertips to do the simple
and easy stuff for me.  Having to remember to activate a virtual environment when I go
into a directory and deactivate it when I leave was a headache.  There were many times
I forgot to do just that, and it caused a bit of chaos.</p>
<p>I feel that PipEnv keeps everything I need together and keeps it in the right place
for me: the base of the project.  If I need to run a Python script from the project,
I use <code>pipenv run python {script-name}.py</code>, a format that makes sense to me. If I need
to check the project’s dependencies, the <code>pipenv graph</code> command is there, with an
intuitive output format. If I need to recreate the project in a new directory, the
<code>pipenv sync</code> command is there, and completes its job properly</p>
<p>Basically, it is a tool that I find useful and that I think makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up<a class="headerlink" href="#wrap-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While there are options out there on how to maintain Python projects, the
one that I prefer is PipEnv.  Newer options exist, such as
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>,
but for projects that I rely on, I want something that has been battle tested
thoroughly.</p>
<p>I feel that PipEnv is the best option that easily meets my requirements.</p>
