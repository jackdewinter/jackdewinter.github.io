<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="http://localhost:8000/2020/07/27/markdown-linter-addressing-the-initial-markdown-transformer-issues/">last article</a>, I walked through the
items that I chose to look at on the issues list, detailing my process for resolving
each one.  In this article, I detail how I continued the march forward to increase my
consistency check confidence by implementing a token to Markdown transformer.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having resolved and removed a good chunk of items from the issues list, I decided that
it was a good time to get back to the Markdown transformer.  While my initial attempt
at implementing the transformer yielded 8 new items on my issues list, I was hopeful
that this next batch of features for the transformer would be less error prone.  Perhaps
error prone is not the right phrase… how about “error discovering”?  Don’t get me
wrong, if there are issues with any part of the project, I want to know about them so
I can prioritize them.  I was just hoping that the number of new items that I found
would be lower than last time.</p>
<p>It is with that hopeful mindset that I started to work on implementing the
transformations for other Markdown features, except for container blocks and link
related blocks.  That was a block of work that I felt comfortable and confident about
working on.  Link transformations were next on the list, with container blocks taking
a distant third.  I knew I still needed to tackle them, I was just not as confident
as with the much simpler inline processing and leaf block handling.  By handling the
simpler cases first, I hoped to build up my confidence to work on the links in the
subsequent section.  Well, as long as I didn’t discover as many errors as with the
last chunk of work!</p>

<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="http://localhost:8000/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commits between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/c9cd5e54a7a6167594dbce593e8869856db6db32">19 Jul 2020</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/7151ea88a180bdc4b977940e90e9db4908b13ede">26 Jul 2020</a>.</p>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-commits">Looking At the Commits<a class="headerlink" href="#looking-at-the-commits" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the commits for this chunk of work, it may look like I did the HTML block on
the Sunday, then took the week off, restarting the work on Saturday.  For no other
reason than dumb luck, I just hit a wall for transforming SetExt Heading tokens.
Everything else just flew right by!  More on that in a bit.</p>
<h2 id="adding-html-support">Adding HTML Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-html-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>HTML block tokens were the next Markdown elements to work on, chosen randomly.  While
writing that week’s article, I just needed a bit of a break, so I thought I would
do a bit of work on a random element.  I honestly did not think it would be so easy that
I would complete it with only 25 lines of code changed, including blank lines.  It really
did not occur to me. I was just looking to find something to give my mind a break from
writing the article.</p>
<p>However, I can’t lie about it.  It was refreshing.  Go in, add the transformation, run
the tests, fix 1 or 2 problems that I found, and… done!  It worked so well, I thought
I would do it with the next token.  And that token is the SetExt Heading Token</p>
<h2 id="adding-setext-heading-support">Adding SetExt Heading Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-setext-heading-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<h2 id="adding-emphasis-support">Adding Emphasis Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-emphasis-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After the effort required to add the SetExt Heading transformation, I was hesitant to
start working on another token.  It wasn’t a lack of confidence that was causing me to
pause for a bit, it was the work!  After taking 5 days to complete the SetExt Heading
token support, I was exhausted.  So much for relaxing a bit more this summer!</p>
<p>I was therefore very pleased when, after my initial attempt to add the simple
transformation for emphasis, that I found that my work to support this token was almost
complete. The writing of that initial attempt used the information already present in the
token, and was able to satisfy most of the tests in dealing with emphasis.  The only tests
that had a problem were the tests that used the alternate emphasis character <code>_</code> and its
slightly altered emphasis rules.  When I originally added the <code>EmphasisMarkdownToken</code>
class, the HTML transformer did not need to know which character was used for emphasis,
only the level of emphasis in the <code>emphasis_length</code> field.</p>
<p>To address that problem, I added the <code>emphasis_character</code> field to the
<code>EmphasisMarkdownToken</code> class.  This was followed up by some small changes in the
<code>__process_emphasis_pair</code> function to ensure that the new field was being properly
initialized in both the <code>EmphasisMarkdownToken</code> constructor and the emphasis block’s end
token constructor.  The change in the end token was a bit trickier in that it does not
have a specific place for the character, just a generic <code>extra_end_data</code> variable.
Those changes modified the code from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>            <span class="n">EmphasisMarkdownToken</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">emphasis_length</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
            <span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_inline_emphasis</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">emphasis_length</span><span class="p">),</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>            <span class="n">EmphasisMarkdownToken</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">emphasis_length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">emphasis_character</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
            <span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_inline_emphasis</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">,</span> \
                 <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">emphasis_length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">":"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">emphasis_character</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These changes made sure that both the start of the emphasis block and the end of the
emphasis block had access to the emphasis character that had been used.  To accommodate
these changes, a trivial change was needed in the HTML transformer.  Once that was done,
I temporarily disabled the consistency checks and ran the full set of tests against
those changes.  Perhaps I am paranoid, but even with such a small change, I wanted to
run the full battery of GFM specification tests to ensure that those changes were solid
on their own before adding in more changes.</p>
<p>With those changes in place and tests all passing, I then returned to the Markdown
transformer.  Due to the above work, the Markdown transfer was changed to be aware of the
emphasis character used.  Similarly to the HTML transformer, the Markdown transformer
only required a few lines to be changed to accommodate the new versions of the tokens.
After that work was completed, the consistency checks were enabled and I was glad to find
out that all emphasis tests were passing on the first try.  Compared to the last element,
this element was a breeze!</p>
<h2 id="adding-autolink-and-raw-html-support">Adding Autolink and Raw HTML Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-autolink-and-raw-html-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Seemingly on a roll, the Autolink token support was added in 15 minutes and the raw HTML
token support was added in just over 10 minutes.  In both cases, the tokens contained all
the required information, allowing the transformation to be accomplished with very simple
functions.  The testing for these changes was likewise, quick, as the amount of code
that was changed was small.  As these changes took less than 30 minutes combined, there
really isn’t anything more to add.</p>
<h2 id="adding-code-span-support">Adding Code Span Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-code-span-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Trivial, Hard, Decent, Trivial.  That was the effort I required to add the elements
documented in the last 4 sections.  Picking Code Spans by random, I wasn’t sure where
the “Wheel of Effort” would land this time.  It turned out that adding support for the
code span tokens was a bit more difficult than adding support for the Autolink token
and the Raw HTML token, but it wasn’t much more difficult.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I first needed to change the constructor for the
<code>InlineCodeSpanMarkdownToken</code> class to keep track of three additional fields:
<code>extracted_start_backticks</code>, <code>leading_whitespace</code>, and <code>trailing_whitespace</code>. While
those 3 fields were easy add to the token and populate with the right information,
their use in a large number of tests required small changes in each of those tests.
However, once those changes were out of the way, the changes to the Markdown
transformer to properly support the Code Span token were minimal.</p>
<p>After running the all the tests with the above changes implemented, everything looked
good except for a couple of tests.  When I looked at those tests closer, there were
only a few tests failing, but in each case the test Markdown contained a code span with
a newline
character in the middle of it.  While Code Span tokens keep everything within their
boundaries exactly as they are, including backslashes and character reference sequences,
newline characters are a separate matter.</p>
<p>When a Code Span element has a newline character in it, that newline character gets
replaced with a single space character.  This introduced a bit of a problem for the
Markdown transformer, as the HTML transformer was expecting a space character and the
Markdown transformer was expecting a newline character.  Luckily, I was able to
repurpose some work I did a couple of weeks ago for
<a href="core-9.md#Handling-Character-References">character references</a> in indented code blocks.
As I want to ensure that I represent both states of the code spans, I can replacing the
newline characters with the text <code>\a\n\a \a</code> instead of replacing it with a single space
character.  At that point, I know both the before processing and after processing states
of that character.</p>
<p>Going forward with those changes, I went to look at any errors with the HTML
transformer, but there weren’t any.  It turned out that the work I did on
<a href="20b129ee1b2058b4495395251d25a8fafa88bfa3">16 Jul 2020</a>
included adding a call to the <code>resolve_references_from_text</code> function, then housed in
the <code>tranform_to_gfm.py</code> module.  To be honest, I wasn’t aware that I did that, but its
nice that it was already in place.  That just left the changes to the Markdown
transformer to resolve any replacement markers in that data.</p>
<p>Running the tests at each interval along the way, I was confident that I had made the
right changes.  But there is always that moment where I say to myself “did I remember
everything?”.  Fighting past that thought, I ran the all the tests and was happy to
see that Code Spans were now being transformed properly.</p>
<h2 id="adding-fenced-code-block-support">Adding Fenced Code Block Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-fenced-code-block-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similar to the work done for the Code Span tokens, the Fenced Code Block tokens were
missing some information, but in this case, that information was tied to both the
start token and the end token.  For the start token, the information was being
serialized properly, but I needed to add specific member variables for each of the
arguments being passed in, to allow them to be used later.  For the end token, instead
of trying to add a lot of generic information to the token, I opted to add a new
member variable <code>start_markdown_token</code> to allow for a reference to the start token.  In
this way, I could easily reference the data of the start token without having to
duplicate it in a generic way in the end token.</p>
<p>When I started testing these changes, there were a couple of tests that were trickier
than the others to get working.  Debugging into those tests, I quickly found that the
whitespace removed from the start of lines within the fenced code block was causing
issues for the Markdown transformer.  [used same as above, but replaced with noop]</p>
<h2 id="adding-atx-heading-support">Adding Atx Heading Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-atx-heading-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the way my <code>Wheel of Effort</code> had been spinning during this chunk of work, I had no
clue where the effort for this token would land on that metaphorical wheel.  On one
side, there were plenty of decent or simple changes for many of the tokens.  On the
other side were the SetExt Heading tokens, which took days.  It was with trepidation
and caution that I started to work on the support for this token.</p>
<p>And it was within a couple of minutes of starting that I figure out this was going to
end up in the trivial category.  Piggybacking on the work documented in the last
section regarding the <code>start_markdown_token</code> field, the big change for the parser was
to set this field in the end token for the heading.  Seeing as the change was solely
additive, I jumped to the Markdown transformer, and added the handlers for both the
<code>AtxHeadingMarkdownToken</code> and its corresponding end token.  The handlers were both
simple, just regurgitating the token’s member variables back into a Markdown form.</p>
<p>Running the tests, I was pleased to see that most of the tests worked on the first
run.  The ones that didn’t caused me to look at the tests more closely.  It was there
that I realized that the only tests that were failing were tests with closing
Atx Heading characters.  Looking specifically at the code to handle those closing
characters, I discovered that I had transposed two variables, producing weird results
in the output.  Fixing that error, the tests ran without any issues.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I mentioned in the last article that I started to believe that I could see the
end of the project, it was this chunk of work that brought it into sharper focus.
In my mind, anyone can say that they can parse a Markdown document, but for me,
anything short of being able to empirically prove that the project can parser the
Markdown project properly is a failure.</p>
<p>The comparisons between the HTML parser output
and the HTML output from the GFM specification? They proved the project could get the
HTML right for those specific cases.  The comparisons between the line numbers and
column numbers from the parser’s tokens and the consistency check algorithms?  They
proved that the project could pinpoint the origin of any element in the original
Markdown document.  The consistency check using the Markdown transformer?  It proved
that the project could, with certainty, transform the Markdown document into an
intermediate form and then back again, with no loss of data.</p>
<p>From my point of view, each one of these checks was building on the work of the other,
providing solid, empirical proof that the parser had properly tokenized the document.</p>
<p>[more]</p>
<p>That new level of confidence spoke to me. The scenario tests were effective.  The
consistency checks were working.  And in my mind, the project was clearly past the
half-way point on its journey to the finish line!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Link transformations were next on the list of Markdown
transformations to add. [more]</p>
