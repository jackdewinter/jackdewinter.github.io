<p>As detailed in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/03/30/markdown-linter-adding-inline-links/#Why-Inline-Links?">the last article</a>,
the remaining work left on the main parser consists of inline links,
link reference definitions, reference links, and image links.  Inline links were
covered in the last article.  While I could try and
come up with some grand reason for doing the link reference definitions next, the
truth is simple: they were next on the list.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience For This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commit of
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/680e9d9fd7472e69232a191ca84ce9bc5ff4aaec">22 March 2020</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-link-reference-definitions">What Are Link Reference Definitions?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-link-reference-definitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/03/30/markdown-linter-adding-inline-links/#what-is-an-inline-link">last article</a>,
I introduced inline links and how they present the text to appear in the
link (link label), the link itself (link destination), and an optional title for that
link (link title).  Link reference definitions are a related concept in that they take
the link destination and link title parts of the link and store them in a map, to be
used at a different time.</p>
<p>Basically, where an inline link uses the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">link</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>a link definition uses the form:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">link</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The main difference between the two elements is that a link reference definition does
not add any elements into the HTML document by itself.  To utilize the link reference
definition, a reference link must be added to the document that has a
normalized <sup id="fnref:normalized"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:normalized">1</a></sup> link label that matches the normalized <sup id="fnref2:normalized"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:normalized">1</a></sup> link
label from a link reference definition present elsewhere in the same Markdown document.
For example, using the simplest form of reference links, a
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#shortcut-reference-link">shortcut reference link</a>,
the following Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">link</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">link</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>creates a link reference definition and uses it, generating the following HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"/uri"</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"title"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>link<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While the normalization rules<sup id="fnref3:normalized"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:normalized">1</a></sup> are somewhat complex, in most cases it just
means using the same link label in both the reference link and the link reference
definition.  Unless you happen to get into the more interesting aspects of the
normalization rules, both reference links and link reference definitions are easy to
use, by design.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-link-reference-definitions">Why Use Link Reference Definitions?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-link-reference-definitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/03/30/markdown-linter-adding-inline-links/#i-use-inline-links-almost-exclusively">last article</a>,
I mentioned that I use inline links exclusively.  Now that I have introduced link
resource definitions and reference links, I can provide more context on the difference
between them. Using a simple
<a href="https://lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum generator</a>,
I came up with the following two examples.  This first example contains an inline link:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Nam</span> <span class="n">efficitur</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">turpis</span> <span class="n">ac</span> <span class="n">vestibulum</span> <span class="n">imperdiet</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nulla</span> <span class="n">mi</span> <span class="n">mollis</span> <span class="n">erat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nec</span> <span class="n">efficitur</span> <span class="n">nunc</span>
<span class="n">lorem</span> <span class="n">rutrum</span> <span class="n">metus</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Vestibulum</span> <span class="n">dictum</span> <span class="n">lacinia</span> <span class="n">lacus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">at</span> <span class="n">ornare</span> <span class="n">quam</span> <span class="n">consequat</span> <span class="n">ultrices</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">Nam</span> <span class="n">quam</span> <span class="n">leo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">aliquet</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">luctus</span> <span class="k">in</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">porttitor</span> <span class="n">non</span> <span class="n">quam</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">lipsum</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">).</span>
<span class="n">Donec</span> <span class="n">tincidunt</span> <span class="n">augue</span> <span class="n">nisi</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">sed</span>
<span class="n">pellentesque</span> <span class="n">nisl</span> <span class="n">porttitor</span> <span class="n">vel</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and this second example contains a reference link, specifically a shortcut reference
link:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Nam</span> <span class="n">efficitur</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">turpis</span> <span class="n">ac</span> <span class="n">vestibulum</span> <span class="n">imperdiet</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nulla</span> <span class="n">mi</span> <span class="n">mollis</span> <span class="n">erat</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">nec</span> <span class="n">efficitur</span> <span class="n">nunc</span>
<span class="n">lorem</span> <span class="n">rutrum</span> <span class="n">metus</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">Vestibulum</span> <span class="n">dictum</span> <span class="n">lacinia</span> <span class="n">lacus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">at</span> <span class="n">ornare</span> <span class="n">quam</span> <span class="n">consequat</span> <span class="n">ultrices</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">Nam</span> <span class="n">quam</span> <span class="n">leo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">aliquet</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">luctus</span> <span class="k">in</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">porttitor</span> <span class="n">non</span> <span class="n">quam</span><span class="p">].</span> <span class="n">Donec</span> <span class="n">tincidunt</span> <span class="n">augue</span> <span class="n">nisi</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">sed</span> <span class="n">pellentesque</span> <span class="n">nisl</span> <span class="n">porttitor</span> <span class="n">vel</span><span class="p">.</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">porttitor</span> <span class="n">non</span> <span class="n">quam</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">lipsum</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">/</span>
</pre></div>
<p>From an HTML output point of view, both examples generate the exact same output.</p>
<p>In both cases, the examples are presented as I would normally include them in my
articles, folding each line after the 90 characters that I keep my Markdown editor set
to.  Applying my own stylistics, when I add an inline link I ensure that it begins at
the start of a new line to ensure that I can clearly identify it as a link.  In
trying an equivalent example with a reference link instead of an inline link, the
style that I chose was to place the link label delimiters (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) around the link
label itself with no change in formatting, with the link reference definition following
later in the document.  While link reference definitions can precede or follow
any reference links that use them, to me this seemed like the right way to do it.</p>
<p>From my point of view, I find that the inline reference provides better readability for
me and how I read my articles when authoring them.  Perhaps it is through having
authored and proofed many articles in this format, but to me, not having the link
information right in the paragraph feels like a grammatical or spelling error. And
while I did not really think about it before, when proofing the Markdown version of
my articles, I don’t really “see” the link destination and link title until I slow down
on my final passes.  Regardless of the reasoning behind it, I just find it works better
for me to read the Markdown version of articles with inline links.</p>
<p>Please note that this view is solely my own.  When performing a similar evaluation for
yourself or your organization, it is important to consider your own criteria when
determining which options, reference links or inline links, is best for you.</p>
<h2 id="hitting-implementation-issues">Hitting Implementation Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#hitting-implementation-issues" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having implemented inline links as documented in the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/03/30/markdown-linter-adding-inline-links/#implementing-the-algorithm">last article</a>,
I started working on the link reference definitions thinking they would be easy.  In
the case of the first example,
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-161">example 161</a>, it was in fact pretty easy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>A complete link label, followed by both a link destination and a link title.  All on
one line.  Then add a simple shortcut reference link to reference the previously added
link reference definition.  Nice. Compact.  Complete.</p>
<p>It was when I moved on to
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-162">example 162</a>
that all of the issues started:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="w">   </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">           </span><span class="s1">'the title'</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The first important issue to understand is that link reference definitions are
processed as leaf nodes instead of inline text.  To keep the memory footprint of the
parser low, I made an early design decision to
only get the text from the input source one line at a time.<sup id="fnref:lineByLine"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:lineByLine">2</a></sup>  While the
proper implementation of that design is still in the future, that design limits the main
parsing function of the parser to only knowing about the current line, with no
built-in capacity for look-ahead or look-behind.  Remember this issue, as I will get
back to it in just a minute.</p>
<p>The second important issue is that unlike all previous leaf node elements, it can take
multiple lines to determine if the current link reference definition element is valid.
In example 162, as provided above, it isn’t until the end of line following the second
<code>'</code> character on line 3 that the link reference definition is determined to be valid.
To better highlight this problem, consider
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-165">example 165</a>
which provides for an exaggerated example of this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'</span>
<span class="s1">title</span>
<span class="s1">line1</span>
<span class="s1">line2</span>
<span class="s1">'</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>While the link reference definition as stated in example 165 is valid, it isn’t until
the 5th line, where the second <code>'</code> character followed by the end of the line
closes off the link title, that the entire link reference definition is deemed valid.
By making one small change to the previous example, removing that previously mentioned
5th line, that entire link reference definition is rendered invalid, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">'</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">title</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">line1</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">line2</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>After that one small change, instead of a link reference definition followed by a valid
link reference, both elements are now just interpreted as plain text.</p>
<p>Remember a couple of paragraphs ago when I mentioned “remember this issue” when talking
about processing link reference definitions as leaf nodes?  Here is the payoff.</p>
<p>Because of my design choice to process the Markdown document one line at a time, I
needed to add extra logic to the parser to allow me to “rewind” those lines.  In the
case of the modified example 165, the entire link reference definition is rendered
invalid, and the parser must rewind to the start of the link reference definition.
However, when it starts parsing the lines again, care must be taken to inform the
parser that it cannot consider the newly rewound lines to be eligible for a valid
link reference definition.  Painful, but not too painful.</p>
<p>Following along from that change, if we do a similar change to example 162 by removing
the final <code>'</code> character
from the definition, it poses a different problem.  While the removal of the 5th line of
example 165 invalidates the entire link reference definition, removing the final <code>'</code>
character from example 162 only invalidates the link title, leaving the rest of the link
definition valid.  To deal with this, I needed to not only have logic to go backwards
towards the start of the link reference definition, but to stop that rewinding if
whatever part of the definition that was not rewound turned out to be a valid
definition.  While the rewinding was a headache and somewhat obvious<sup id="fnref:parsing"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:parsing">3</a></sup>,
aborting the rewinding if a valid link reference definition “fragment” was found was
not obvious to me at all.</p>
<p>That code was painful.  Honestly speaking, that logic alone took about half of the 5
days required to get the multiple-line aspect of link reference definition parsing
properly.  A decent amount of that time was taken up with rewriting the logic for
extracting the link
label, link definition, and link title to handle being straddled over multiple lines.
But the real “fun” was making sure that rewinding the lines would properly rewind the
token stream and token stack in the parser.</p>
<p>While it took a lot of work to get there, it was personally fulfilling when I got it
right.  It wasn’t an easy issue to solve and coming up with a clean solution wasn’t
easy.  As a bonus, my dog stopped looking at me with a funny expression.  It
was pointed out to me that he did that when facepalmed myself whenever I got the
parsing wrong.  Personally, I considered that a 2-in-1 benefit!</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There have only been a few issues that have taxed my experience to solve them and
implementing link reference definitions was one of them.  That is both a good thing and
a bad thing.  On the good side, due to my experience and stubbornness, I was able to
modify my implementation to deal with the issue without having to change my design
decision.  On the bad side, there is only one test with a link reference definition
being within a container block, and that leaves a lot of questions about how to handle
failures within those containers.  While I noted the later down for subsequent testing,
it still leaves me feeling a bit uneasy that I had to modify the parser to handle that.</p>
<p>Considering where I am with the parser, I am glad that I hit that issue now, and not
after I finished the parser.  While it was painful to go through, it did reinforce
a few things about the design of the parser so far.</p>
<p>The first thing that was
reinforced was that, with only one exception, my early decision to do line-by-line
parsing is viable.  While there may be parser extensions that change that, the
number of exceptions in the link reference definition category should be low.  If
I can then combine that with some Python generator logic, hopefully I can keep the
memory profile of the parser low.</p>
<p>The second thing that was reinforced was that the general structure of the parser was
properly designed and implemented.  While I still need to take some time and refactor
individual
groups of functions into their own modules, the actual function themselves are
durable.  Except for the link helper functions and a few core functions, I
did not have to change any other functionality to handle the failure rewind scenario.
In those few functions I changed, it was either to specifically handle that scenario
or to pass information back to the main parser function about how to handle the rewind.
Compared to past situations I have encountered; I consider it a benefit
that I only had to change the small amount of code that I did.</p>
<p>Finally, my decision to use inline links over reference links was reinforced. In more
closely examining the difference between the
two types of links, I believe I better understand and appreciate both types of links.
While I agree that writing Markdown with reference links will more closely approximate
how the paragraphs will look when completed<sup id="fnref:JohnGruberMarkdown"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:JohnGruberMarkdown">4</a></sup>, the absence of the
link destination and link title reduce my comprehension of the paragraph as a whole.
I find myself making the same decision as before, but now I believe I can more
clearly communicate the options for both types of links and why I chose inline links
over reference links.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The list of what is left to complete in the parser is getting shorter and shorter.
With inline links and link reference definitions tested and completed, only the
full implementation of reference links and image links remain.  While a lot of
foundation work has already been set up for these features, I am wary of declaring
that it will be an easy job from here on it.  But with only 2 features left, I know
the start of the real linting work in coming soon!</p>

<p>Long winded version: To normalize a label, strip off the opening and closing brackets, perform the Unicode case fold, strip leading and trailing whitespace and collapse consecutive internal whitespace to a single space.  Shorter version: reduce or eliminate whitespace and do a case-insensitive comparison. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:normalized" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2:normalized" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref3:normalized" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:lineByLine">
<p>To keep the memory footprint of a parser low, the parser design should try and only keep the information that is required for parsing in memory.  By parsing the Markdown input line by line, I do not have to worry about having to load the entire Markdown input into memory before I can begin parsing it. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:lineByLine" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:parsing">
<p>Except for a Lisp parser that I once wrote, I cannot think of a single parser where I didn’t have to rewind at least one complex entity out of the 25+ parsers that I have written. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:parsing" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>As per John Gruber’s original intentions.  Go to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#em">this part</a> of his original Markdown article and go to the paragraph preceding the start of the emphasis section.
