<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/06/29/markdown-linter-rabbit-hole-3-trying-to-dig-myself-out/">last article</a>,
I talked about how I was pulling myself out of the rabbit hole that I dug myself into,
by finding a small task, and completing it with panache.<sup id="fnref:panache"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:panache">1</a></sup>  In this article, I
talk about how I continued to get my confidence back by resolving items on the issues
list while increasing the quality of the project.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/06/29/markdown-linter-rabbit-hole-3-trying-to-dig-myself-out/#what-was-my-experience-so-far">end of the last article</a>,
I talked about how I was starting to get out of the negative headspace that I found
myself in, making progress with the project at the same time.  The project’s
progress was a good thing, but it was my emotions towards the project that I was more
concerned with.  I have seen people stop working on their passion projects for
varied reasons, and I just did not want a momentary lapse of
confidence on my part to be the reason that I stopped working on this project.</p>
<p>When I was pulling myself up out of my rabbit hole, I came to the realization that part
of the reason that my confidence took a bit of a hit, were the contents of the issues
list. While I am pretty sure that not every item on the list is an actual issue, until I
debug and verify each one, each item on that list is a potential bug.  And each
one of those potential bugs represented a bit of uncertainty that lowered my confidence.
Given that realization, taking some time to go through and “weed” the project’s issue
list seemed like a good idea!</p>

<p>The first three tasks on my list were simple things to resolve, little things that
I kept on meaning to do when I had some time. Completing them to get me warmed up
for the issues list was a good, solid plan.</p>
<p>The first item on
my list was some simple refactoring of the <code>assert_token_consistency</code> function in the
<code>utils.py</code> module.  I had added some decent functionality to it in the last couple of
weeks, and it was time to make sure that the module was returned to its normal, properly
organized state.  The needed changes were simple. Start with a bit of extracting code
into functions, then add some function and variable renaming, and finally test the
changes to make sure I did not break anything.  While nothing changed in the source
code for the project, it felt good knowing that the test code was just <em>that</em> much
cleaner.</p>
<p>The next item was also a simple task: add reporting of leading whitespace to the next
list item token (<code>li</code>).  When I was adding the code to handle leading whitespace for the
list start tokens, somehow, I forgot the new list item token in that work.  I noticed
this when I went to verify the next list item tokens in the consistency checks, and
there was no indication of the leading whitespace, other than the <code>indent_level</code>
variable. For the sake of those consistency checks, this needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>Adding this support into the consistency checks with the new list item tokens
modifications in place was almost trivial.
The <em>do not do new list item token until fixed</em> check was removed and replaced with a
simple calculation of the <code>init_ws</code> variable, in keeping with the handling of the list
start tokens.  To complete those changes, I also added some code in the
<code>__maintain_block_stack</code> function to guarantee that new list item tokens were 
properly added and removed from the stack.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to use PyCharm and its enhanced code analysis tools to take a look
at the project, fixing things where possible.  I have
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/20/markdown-linter-adding-image-links-and-simple-cleanup/#simple-cleanup-3-pycharm-static-code-analysis">talked before</a>
about how PyCharm, while not a good development environment for me, is a product I
definitely like to use as a tool on a current project.  For me, the most useful of these
tools is a comprehensive look at what arguments and variables are used, and whether
they are needed.  In addition, PyCharm has a project dictionary that allows
me to search for typos in comments and variable names while maintaining a custom
dictionary that allows me to remove often used terms and abbreviations.
Combined, I feel that using PyCharm as a tool just adds an extra level of quality
and cleanliness to the project.</p>
<p>While none of these tasks were big issues to tackle, they were small tasks that were
easily resolved and crossed off my mental “when I get time” list. And one less item
on that list is one less thing to worry about!</p>

<h3 id="scenario-86a-indented-code-blocks">Scenario 86a: Indented Code Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#scenario-86a-indented-code-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are times when I look at an issue and I know exactly why I put that issue onto the
issues list.  This was not one of those times.  The notes I have for this one clearly
state that scenario 86a is a modification of
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-86">scenario 86</a>
, but with 9 leading spaces
before the indented code block.  Those same notes are even clear that the reason I
added this new scenario was because I was concerned that scenario 86 only tested a case
where the length of the extracted whitespace equaled the length of the remaining
whitespace.  What I did not know was why I thought this was an issue.</p>
<p>I did some due diligence here and found nothing.  I temporarily added some extra debug
code around the indented code block code but did not find anything useful.  After
making a mental note to myself to write better notes on why I added items to the issues
list, I removed it from the issues list and moved on.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-87-more-fun-with-indented-code-blocks">Scenario 87: More Fun with Indented Code Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#scenario-87-more-fun-with-indented-code-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>When I was doing the initial work to add the line/column number to the tokens back in
May, I wrote an issue to myself as a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>087 - shouldn’t it be inside of the indented code block?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the issue with scenario 86a, it was easy to see why I wrote that question.  If
you look at the example by itself, the blank line before the reported start of the
indented code block is also indented by 4 space characters.  However, when I looked at
the example within the context of the GFM specification for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-87">example 87</a>,
the line before the example reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blank lines preceding or following an indented code block are not included in it:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An honest question, an honest and researched answer, and an issue that was quickly
resolved.  Next!</p>
<h3 id="scenarios-235-236-252-and-255-indented-code-blocks-and-lists">Scenarios 235, 236, 252, and 255: Indented Code Blocks and Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#scenarios-235-236-252-and-255-indented-code-blocks-and-lists" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In each of these four cases, every scenario had to do with something
that may look like an indented code block being started from within a list. Like
scenario 87 in the last section, I could see how these scenario tests raised
questions.  For each one of these examples, from a quick glance it is hard to tell if
the number of spaces is correct from the example.</p>
<p>In the case of
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-235">scenario 235</a>
, my first inclination was that I had coded something wrong.
The <code>-</code> character is followed by 4 spaces, so <code>one</code> should be in an indented code block.
Right?  Almost.  The actual start sequence for the list is not <code>-</code>, but <code>-{space}</code>. As
such, the list starts with the <code>-</code> character at column number 2, the space character at
column number 3, followed by 3 space characters for a total indent to column number 6.
The blank line
then ends the list on line number 2, and line 3 with 5 leading spaces is picked up as
an indented code block.  The scenario test was correct. Yes!</p>
<p>The general math for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-236">scenario 236</a>
is the same, but because the text <code>two</code> is indented 6 spaces
instead of scenario 237’s 5 spaces, it counts as a continuation of the original list.
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-252">Scenario 252</a> and
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-255">scenario 255</a>
are just variations of this, with and without the indented code blocks confusing the
issue.  In each case, the scenario tests were correct.  But I felt good that I had
questioned whether they were correct, and it was solidly answered in the positive.</p>
<p>However, even though I did not find an immediate issue, I did find a future issue.  In
each of these cases, the <code>indent_level</code> associated with the list is assumed to be
comprised of
space characters.  This assumption is fine for now, as the current consistency
checks explicitly ignore checking tests that contain tabs.  But when the tab character
support is enabled in the consistency checks, extra calculations will need to be added
to ensure the column numbers remain accurate.  This was not something I needed to
deal with now, but it would be an issue later.</p>
<h3 id="blank-lines-and-html-blocks">Blank Lines and HTML Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#blank-lines-and-html-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I initially thought that this one was an open-and-shut case; the issue being noted down
as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>blanks lines, if starts with 2 ws, is it (x,1) or (x,3)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious answer is that it is always 1, as I indicated in the commit message for
removing the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Answered question: blank lines always start at 1, as do HTML blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To verify this, I did a a quick scan of the test code for the text <code>html-block</code> and
the text <code>BLANK</code>, looking for the string values of their respective tokens in the
scenario test output.  As expected, each of those tokens contained a column number
of 1.  Until they didn’t.  </p>
<p>The HTML block token and the blank line token always start at the start of the line, and
hence have a column number of 1.  But when those leaf block tokens are created within a
container block, the start of the line is where the
container block says it is.  Therefore, for blank lines created within a list block,
their column number becomes the indent level for the container block.</p>
<p>The good news here is that I had an issue with the commit message, not the source
code.  If I could go back and correct the commit message<sup id="fnref:doNotRebase"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:doNotRebase">2</a></sup> to make it more
correct, I would have changed it to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Answered question: blank lines always start at 1, as do HTML blocks, except when enclosed by a container block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a bit of double checking, those scenarios and their tokens were also verified.
Another quick issue to resolve and get off the list!</p>
<h3 id="scenarios-197-257-and-262-blank-lines-and-lists">Scenarios 197, 257, and 262: Blank Lines and Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#scenarios-197-257-and-262-blank-lines-and-lists" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This issue was logged in order to explore whether or not there were issues with lists
that started with a blank line, as in
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-257">scenario 257</a>
and
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-262">scenario 262</a>.
To start with a baseline for blank lines, the example for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-197">scenario 197</a>
is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span>

<span class="n">aaa</span>
<span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span>

<span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">aaa</span>

<span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
<p>(<strong>Aside:</strong> Due to previous issues with me missing spaces in the examples, I had
previously replaced the spaces in this example with the character sequence <code>\a</code>, making
the space character more visible.  Then, before passing this string to the test code,
the string is processed this string by invoking <code>.replace("\a", " ")</code> on the resultant
string, transforming it into an accurate representation of the example.  This greatly
reduced the number of times that I missed trailing whitespace to zero!)</p>
<p>In the scenario test for scenario 197, the tokens for the 1st, 4th, and 8th lines,
includes the leading whitespace while maintaining a column number of 1.  For example,
the token for the blank line on line 4 is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[BLANK(4,1):  ]
</pre></div>
<p>Therefore, I compared that behavior to the blank line’s behavior inside of a
simple list block, such as with this Markdown for scenario 257:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="err">\</span><span class="n">a</span>
  <span class="n">foo</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and the differences were clear:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[BLANK(1,5):]
</pre></div>
<p>There are two differences between this token and the uncontained token above.  The
first is
that unlike scenario 197, the leading whitespace that was removed is not stored in the
token.  The second is that the column number is 5, when it should be 2.  Based on my
experience with blank lines in the last section, it was easy to see that the column
number should be 2, given the unordered list start character <code>-</code> and the mandatory
space that followed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-262">Scenario 262</a>
was a far easier issue to deal with.  Its Markdown is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">*</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Simple.  An unordered list start token, by itself in a document.  Thanks to the work
I did on scenario 257, this one was easily verified.  If scenario 257 should produce a
blank line token that contains 3 leading space characters, then scenario 262 should
contain a blank line token with no leading space characters.</p>
<p>As this was just researching the issue, I resolved the existing issue and added more
specific issues to be properly addressed later. One issue to do with recording
whitespace for blank lines in a container, and the other issue for correcting the
column number of that same blank line in a container.</p>
<h3 id="scenarios-extra001-and-extra002-checking-for-correctness">Scenarios Extra001 and Extra002: Checking for Correctness<a class="headerlink" href="#scenarios-extra001-and-extra002-checking-for-correctness" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Looking at how
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#blank-lines">blank lines</a>
are defined in the GFM specification, from a purely transform-to-HTML point of view,
it is obvious that a document that only contains whitespace will produce an
empty HTML document.  This is mainly due to the stipulations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blank lines between block-level elements are ignored</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blank lines at the beginning and end of the document are also ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But for those blank lines to be ignored, it stands to reason that from a tokenization
point of view, there must be a blank line token to ignore.  And as the linter operates
on tokens, the scenario tests <code>test_extra_001</code> and <code>test_extra_002</code> were added to
make sure the right blank tokens are produced.</p>
<p>After the previous work in the above sections with blank lines, verifying these
scenario tests was quick and painless.  In reverse order, the text for scenario test
<code>test_extra_002</code> was a simple document with 3 spaces, hence it needed to produce a
single blank line token with 3 spaces.  With that test solidly in place, it logically
follows that remove those 3 spaces for scenario test <code>test_extra_001</code> would produce a
blank line token with no spaces, which is what the test expects.</p>
<p>While this may have seemed like a trivial test, it is often the trivial cases and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case#Software_engineering">edge cases</a> that trip
up projects.  With everyone on the project worried how a big complex example will be
resolved, sometimes it is those little examples that slip through the crack out into
the wild.</p>
<p>Honestly, even though they are trivial, I just felt better knowing that these trivial
cases were double-checked and covered.</p>
<h3 id="scenarios-559-and-560-link-reference-definitions">Scenarios 559 and 560: Link Reference Definitions?<a class="headerlink" href="#scenarios-559-and-560-link-reference-definitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I almost felt embarrassed when I read this one, as the answer was right in the
scenarios themselves.  The function comments for 559 (and with one small modification,
560) are as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_reference_links_559</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="sd">    Test case 559:  (part 1) A link label must contain at least one non-whitespace character:</span>
<span class="sd">    """</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Using scenario 559 as a benchmark, its Markdown is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="p">[]:</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and the Markdown for scenario 560 is almost the same, except for added whitespace:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span>
 <span class="p">]</span>

<span class="p">[</span>
 <span class="p">]:</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As it is hard to argue with the GFM specification’s definition of a
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#link-label">link label</a>,
I resolved this and moved on.  In both cases, there just was not any whitespace
in the link label.</p>
<p>But I still did due diligence: verified the example, checked the tokens, and after
a slight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facepalm">face-palm</a>, I resolved the issue
and moved on.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-markdowntokens-constructor">Changing the MarkdownToken’s Constructor?<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-markdowntokens-constructor" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting to ramp down on the project work, I hoped that this was a simple issue to
look at and resolve.  I had logged a simple question in the issue list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for all of the tokens that used position_marker, do we need =None any more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was an interesting question in that, except for the <code>MarkdownToken</code> class itself,
none of the child classes have <code>position_marker</code> as an optional argument!  From
that point of view, it would be quick to resolve it.  But I did not feel that I was
doing a complete job, so I decided to run with that idea a bit and find out where it
led me to.</p>
<p>Doing a quick search over the <code>MarkdownToken</code> class and its children, the breakdown
of how the <code>MarkdownToken</code> constructor was called from the child classes were as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>line_number</code> and <code>column_number</code> arguments used: 3</li>
<li><code>position_marker</code> argument used: 10</li>
<li>none of the above arguments used: 11</li>
</ul>
<p>For the “none of the above” case, most of those child classes were for inline tokens
that do not have line/column support yet.  But if the trend of the current statistics
continues, this change may be something to revisit in the future.  Knowing more about
this issue, I was good resolving this issue now, possibly exploring this again in the
future when line/column numbers are added to inline elements.</p>
<h3 id="renaming-the-setext-tokens-whitespace-variable">Renaming the SetExt Token’s Whitespace Variable<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-the-setext-tokens-whitespace-variable" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was finally at the end of my planned issues list, and I was
glad that I was ending on another simple one.  When I was writing my first pass of the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/06/22/markdown-linter-rabbit-hole-2-losing-my-way/#fixing-the-easy-failures">consistency checker</a>,
I noted that I had to special case the SetExt heading tokens, as the member variable
that is consistently named <code>extracted_whitespace</code> for other tokens was mysteriously
named <code>remaining_line</code> for this token.</p>
<p>After performing due diligence to find out where the variable <code>remaining_line</code> was
referenced and what was depending on it, there was no reason to keep this difference
around.  It just made more sense to change the name to the more consistent
<code>extracted_whitespace</code>.  In addition to a simple search-and-replace, this change
allowed me to reduce the complexity of the <code>__calc_initial_whitespace</code> function.</p>
<p>Another small change, but another small step to a cleaner code base!</p>
<h2 id="why-was-this-work-important-to-me">Why Was This Work Important to Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-was-this-work-important-to-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From my personal and professional experience, the longer you let an issue sit
unexplored, the more uncertainty exists with respect to the team’s confidence in a
project.  At the time when I resolved those issues, I was at a more emotional place
than normal, where those uncertainties were weighing more heavily on my confidence.
While it took some time to work through them, it just felt right doing the proper due
diligence on each issue and resolving it.</p>
<p>And the results of resolving these issues were very positive.  With the exception of
adding the proper encapsulation of leading whitespace for new list item tokens, no
other source code was measurably changed.<sup id="fnref:defineMeasurable"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:defineMeasurable">3</a></sup>
With respect to the test code, there were a couple of net-neutral changes for code
quality, but the other changes only added extra tests cases, not changing existing
tests.  Basically, while the work done in this time frame did not change the project’s
code base significantly, it did increase my confidence in the project by eliminating a
few of the existing questions.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As far as recoveries go, I was feeling better after this stint of work.  By going
through the issues list, resolving 9 of those issues, and doing some code cleanup, my
confidence was back on track to be where it was before.  In any project, people
encounter circumstances that force them to evaluate if they have made the right project
decisions up to that point.  Depending on how hard those circumstances hit them and how
hard they hit them, people will decide to continue with the project, abandon it, or
take a wait-and-see approach.  While I was shaken for a bit, I was now back firmly in
the continue with the project camp.</p>
<p>According to
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confidence">Webster</a>,
confidence is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a feeling or consciousness of one’s powers or of reliance on one’s circumstances</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confidence is an emotion, not logic.  It is not a light switch and it is not something
that listens to reason.  Confidence it fickle, hence the expression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One bad apple spoils the barrel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could have resolved 29 issues, but if I found just one issue that looked
like a showstopper, those circumstances could be completely different. Who knows?</p>
<p>Whether it was something substantial or something more lightweight, I knew that I
needed to do some work to try and influence my confidence in a positive direction.  In
this case, resolving several items off of the issues list was needed, and it paid
off.  It was not a guarantee, but a gamble that paid off.</p>
<p>Someone once told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marriage is made up with a whole bunch of days.  You have good days, you have bad days, and you have so-so days.  The sign of a good marriage is that you have more good days that the other two combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar concept applies to working on passion projects, like me and my PyMarkdown
project.  It was just a matter of finding the right thing to do on the project that
would reignite my confidence, and therefore passion, for the project.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having done some decent cleanup, I decided it was time to get back to work on the
consistency checker.  While I realized it was not going to be able to be 100% complete
until I started handling tab characters, I wanted to make a good effort towards getting
it more complete.  And that started with proper accounting of whitespace.</p>
