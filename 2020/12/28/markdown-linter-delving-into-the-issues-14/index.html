<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/12/21/markdown-linter-delving-into-the-issues-13/">last article</a>,
I started the transition to working on Block Quote issues.  Having made good progress
with those issues, this week I continued with those issues, sometimes blurring the
line between Block Quote issues and Block Quote/List Block interactions.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now firmly in the mode of dealing with Block Quote block issues, I was looking forward
to making more progress in this area.  With each week that passed, I was becoming
more aware of how close I was to be able to at least do an initial release of the
project.  Block Quotes, and possibly Block Quote/List Block interactions are
the last big thing that I need to do before taking that leap, so I just needed to
buckle down and work through those issues, wherever they would lead.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-things-up-before-proceeding">Fixing Things Up Before Proceeding<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-things-up-before-proceeding" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before I started doing a lot of work for the week, I decided I needed to get one of
the disabled functions working: <code>test_list_items_282</code>. While it was not a tremendously
important issue, it was one that I had put off for a while, and I just wanted it out of
the way.  Following the GFM Specification exactly, it can be argued that the following
Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">foo</span>
<span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">bar</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">baz</span>
</pre></div>
<p>should either be parsed as a list with 2 items or two lists.  The crux of the issue
is whether the third line is considered a continuation of the second line or
if it is an entirely separate list.  Basically, it all comes down to how your parser
implements paragraphs and paragraph continuations.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the primary authors of the specification (@jgm) chimed in with this
following bit of information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intent was to have language that applies to the starting of list items in the middle of a paragraph that isn’t a direct child of a list item at the same level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While some of the other help was not as useful, that one sentence was.  I did agree
with the other author that Paragraph elements in Markdown are the default element,
however I was not as sure that his interpretation of paragraph continuations was
correct. But this information helped me out a lot.  Using that information, I was able
to quickly put together these lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">is_sub_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">start_index</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">indent_level</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Following the suggestion of @jgm, I changed the exclusion code at the end of the
<code>is_olist_start</code> function to include a reference to <code>is_sub_list</code>.  Following my
usual process, I was quick to find that everything just fell into place, and the
test was passing.  But I was not confident that I had properly fixed the issue,
so I created four variants of the test data, each just a little different from each
other.  It was only when all five tests had passed that I considered the issue resolved
and dealt with.</p>
<h2 id="an-easy-set-of-tests">An Easy Set of Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#an-easy-set-of-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some of these items take days to complete and some take hours.  Until I start working
on them, I never know which bucket they will end up in.  Therefore, when I started
working on this item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">634</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">bq</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I had no clue what was going to happen.  Starting with the basics, I looked at the
Markdown for function <code>test_raw_html_634</code> which was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span>  <span class="o">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">b2</span>
<span class="k">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="ss">"foo"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="k">c</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As the start of the Markdown does not have a single HTML tag, or a HTML tag from one
of the special groups, an HTML block is ruled out.  But when the processing happens
for a Paragraph element, the inside of that paragraph is then filled with Raw HTML
elements, only slightly altering the Markdown when rendered as HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span>  <span class="p">/&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">b2</span>
<span class="na">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"foo"</span> <span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">c</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As the item suggests, placing that same Markdown inside of a List Block or a Block Quote
should result in the same behavior, just inside of that block.  Crossing my fingers for
good luck, I created two variants of that Markdown: one that was prefixed with <code>-</code> and
the other that was prefixed with <code>&gt;</code>.  Things flowed quickly through my usual process
and I was happy to find that these scenarios both worked without any additional changes
being needed.</p>
<h2 id="more-fun-with-block-quotes">More Fun with Block Quotes<a class="headerlink" href="#more-fun-with-block-quotes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With good luck occurring for my last item, I hoped it would carry on to my next item.
So, when I looked for more work to round out the Block Quotes tests, I came across the
following group of items in the issues list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">300</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">different</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">following</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">300</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">extra</span> <span class="n">indent</span> <span class="k">on</span> <span class="n">following</span> <span class="n">item</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">301</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">extra</span> <span class="n">levels</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quotes</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">301</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">indented</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">blocks</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Rather than tackling them separately, I decided to tackle them together as a group.</p>
<p>The first part of that work was making the requested variations on the data for test
function <code>test_list_items_300</code>.  That data was somewhat simple, with the Markdown text
of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span>
  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">c</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To address the first item, I added test function <code>test_list_items_300a</code> that included an
Ordered List element after the Block Quote element, instead of an Unordered List
element.  Test function <code>test_list_items_300b</code> addressed the second item by keeping that
List Item element as an Unordered List element but adding 2 space characters before it
to make it a sublist.</p>
<p>Similarly, test function <code>test_list_items_301</code> has a Markdown text of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">a</span>
  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="o">```</span>
  <span class="k">c</span>
  <span class="o">```</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The new variation of this Markdown in test function <code>test_list_items_301a</code> was to change
the second line to start two Block Quote elements instead of one. Test function
<code>test_list_items_301b</code> modified the test data slightly by indenting each line of the
Fenced Code Block element by one space.  Test function <code>test_list_items_301c</code> did a more
drastic change by replacing the Fenced Code Block element with the single character <code>c</code>
indented from the start of the Block Quote element.  Finally, the <code>test_list_items_301d</code>
function did a more correct version of test function <code>test_list_items_301c</code> by including
a blank line and a <code>c</code> character indented by four spaces, but properly enclosing them
within the Block Quote started on line 2.</p>
<p>With those changes made, it was time to get down to figuring out if there were any
problems and dealing with them!</p>
<h3 id="working-the-problem">Working The Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#working-the-problem" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting with my normal process for working through new test functions, I worked
through the tokens and HTML for each of these functions.  Apart from
the functions <code>test_list_items_301b</code> and <code>test_list_items_301c</code>, the other tests
were producing the tokens that I expected them to.  After trying to get those two
functions working properly for an hour or so, I decided to put them on hold while I got
the other functions cleared up.</p>
<p>Focusing on those other test functions, the HTML output was mostly there, but required
a small amount of fiddling.  Specifically, tests in which there was a Blank Line element
within a Block Quote element within a List Block element, the Blank Line within the
Block Quote was being used to determine whether the list was loose.  As that
Blank Line was within another Block and not within the List Block itself, it should not
have been affecting the calculation of List Block looseness. Luckily, the fix for this
was to add nine lines of code to the <code>__calculate_list_looseness</code> function to properly
increase and decrease the <code>stack_count</code> variable to account for the Block Quote token.</p>
<p>With the tokens and HTML output deal with, it was time to deal with the rehydrated
Markdown and the consistency checks.  The fix to the Markdown was an easy one to
see: the whitespace allocated to the Block Quote tokens was not being added back into
the Markdown text that was generated.  Some easy changes to incorporate that information
was almost as easy to add, leaving the consistency checks.</p>
<p>While the consistency checks took a bit, in retrospect they were somewhat easy to
understand and fix.  At the time though, it took a bit of effort to work through them.
Like the changes in the Markdown generator, changes needed to be introduced to
properly track which part of the Block Quote’s extracted whitespace was applied in the
Markdown generator.  That tracking is done using the Block Quote token’s
<code>leading_text_index</code> variable, which was not being properly incremented to track the
newlines used within the owning Block Quote token.</p>
<p>Once that change was done, things were looking a lot better, but there was a single
case where there was an index error getting that whitespace out of the token.  Upon
debugging, it was obvious that the <code>leading_text_index</code> variable was getting incremented
twice.  Fixing that took a bit of passing information around but was quickly taken
care of.  And with that fix in place, each of the tests that I was working on was
solved and passing properly.</p>
<h3 id="not-everything-was-solved">Not Everything Was Solved<a class="headerlink" href="#not-everything-was-solved" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the other tests passing cleanly, I refocused my efforts on test functions
<code>test_list_items_301b</code> and <code>test_list_items_301c</code>.  Doing my usual research into the
issues, I started to figure out what the tokens generating by the parser should be,
comparing that answer with what was being generated.  It was then that I
noticed that the tokens for the tests were close to normal, but not correct.  In both
test functions, the tokens mostly differed in where the one element stopped and the
next one started.</p>
<p>Now, when I say, “I fiddled with the code”, I really mean I tried normal paths and
interesting paths to try and solve the issue.  And it was similar with these issues.
After around two hours of fiddling, I was no closer to having a solution than when
I first looking at the problem.
In the end, after doing a fair amount of research and debugging, I decided that I was
going to commit the code with functions <code>test_list_items_301b</code> and
<code>test_list_items_301c</code> disabled.  I just was not getting the right “angle” on solving
those issues.  I just felt it would be better to commit what I had and work on those
two functions in the next couple of days, so that is what I did!</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-301b">Dealing With 301B<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-301b" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>During that Saturday, I decided to take another shot at test function
<code>test_list_items_301b</code>.  I knew the the tokens were just wrong.  To quantify that
wrongness, the Markdown text:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">a</span>
  <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">b</span>
   <span class="o">```</span>
   <span class="k">c</span>
   <span class="o">```</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">d</span>
</pre></div>
<p>was produced a Block Quote element that tried to include an empty Fenced Code Block
element into the Block Quote, leaving the <code>c</code> character by itself on
a line outside of the element, followed by another empty Fenced Control Block.  From
prior work on List Blocks, I knew that the Fenced Code Block should terminate the
Block Quote element, as Block Quotes follow similar roads.  It was just a matter of
figuring out how to get there.</p>
<p>Knowing that I have had tried to solve this problem the day before, I decided to take
the hard-line approach of debugging line-by-line through some of the code.  I don’t
usually do this as it is very time consuming and requires meticulous notes.  While I
am comfortable with doing that work, there are just more efficient ways of getting to
the same target.  But with those ways not working for this problem, it was down to
the nitty-gritty.</p>
<p>It was a good thing that I used this approach because it told me something interesting.
Usually, at the start of processing, the code separates the line into extracted
whitespace and parseable line.  In this case, the debugger was showing me that the
separation that I had expected was not done.  As such, when the parser looked at the
raw data for the line, the spaces at the start of the line prevented that line from
being recognized as the start of a Fenced Code Block.</p>
<p>The good news here was that adding these four lines to the <code>__process_lazy_lines</code>
function made everything work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="n">after_ws_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ex_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extract_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">remaining_line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">after_ws_index</span><span class="p">:]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, I just took the same code that split the original <code>line_to_parse</code> variable
in the main-line processor and added it here.  With that code in place, the
<code>is_fenced_code_block</code> function did the rest, properly noticing the Fenced Code Block
start sequence, and properly starting the code block within the Block Quote.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-301c">Dealing With 301C<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-301c" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was just after 6pm PST when I committed the changes for <code>test_list_items_301b</code>, and
I decided to start working on <code>test_list_items_301c</code>.  In this case, it was not the
tokens that were wrong, but the spacing included from one of the lines within a
Block Quote element.  Doing research into the night, I still was unable to figure out
what the magic sequence was to get this working properly.  Rather than press on, I
decided to take a break and spend some time with my family, relaxing myself and my
brain.</p>
<p>This worked well.  Starting again in the morning, I was able to quickly see that there
were two problems that I needed to address.  The first of those problems was that
the function <code>__adjust_paragraph_for_block_quotes</code> was always adding an empty string
to the Block Quote token, which was the problem I was trying to solve.  The second
problem was that it was a great solution for most of the time, this specific test being
one of the few times where it was not.</p>
<p>With that fresh information, I started experimenting and I was able to isolate code in
the <code>parse_line_for_container_blocks</code> function that affected the outcome of the test.
The fun part was that if I took the indentation used for the list and added it to the
token’s data, test <code>test_list_items_301c</code> worked, but other tests failed.  Doing some
extra plumbing and experimentation, I narrowed the active scenario down to specifically
only trigger when the <code>parse_line_for_container_blocks</code> function was triggered within
a paragraph that was within a block quote. [more]</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having felt dread at the prospect of Block Quotes taking as long to complete as
List blocks did, I am happy to report that the feeling is quickly fading.  The
sense I am getting from the issues I am looking at are that there are issues to
deal with, but nothing I have not dealt with already, just variations on it.
On top of that, there are only one type of Block Quotes to worry about with a
very simple start sequence.  I was very solidly feeling that Block Quotes were
going to be a lot easier than List blocks.</p>
<p>That did not mean things were going to be easy though!  I was starting to come close to
the end of the initial set of issues that I had added to the issues list, but I was
adding more as I looked through the code.  This week, I was able to get rid of
a handful of those issues, and it felt good.  But with approximately 70 lines of
items before hitting those that dealt with Rules, Tabs, and Correctness, it was
a sobering reminder that I just needed to get stuff done and done cleanly.</p>
<p>And for me, that often poses a problem.  There are things that I want to do and feel
that I should be doing, and there are things that I need to do.  Resolving any issue
that deals with Tab characters?  Now that is a want, and I can live with a
“stupid” translation of Tabs until I can get the time to make them right.  Resolving
any issues that might uncover scenarios that I have not covered yet.  To the best of
my abilities, that is a must.  But there is a grey area between those two.</p>
<p>Take the item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">image</span> <span class="n">token</span> <span class="n">handling</span> <span class="n">confusing</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">non</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">standard</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I would like to get it resolved, but I am not sure that I need to do that.  I must
balance my desire for wanting things done right and delaying any release with my
knowledge that I can live with it for a couple of months while I get the project out.
And those are the types of decisions that I am going to have to make more and more as
this project gets to its closing stages.  Do I really need it, or can it wait?</p>
<p>At least I know it is going to be fun!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I was just as happy to get some holiday time off in which I could spend more time
with my family as I was to be able to make some solid holiday progress.  This next
week was going to be a good mixture of resolving solid issues, test cleanup, and
code cleanup.  Stay tuned!</p>
