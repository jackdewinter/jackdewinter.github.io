<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have been busy at work on the PyMarkdown project since December 2019, November 2019
if you include project pre-planning.  During that time, I have established a very
consistent schedule for planning the next weeks’ worth of work. Normally I start
planning the next article a couple of days before I write the rough outline for the
current article, ensuring continuity between the two articles.  This occurs
concurrently with the last couple of days of development work for the week, so I usually
have a very healthy picture of where the project is and where the project is going.</p>
<p>This week was very different.  For the first time since I started the project, I was
unsure of the right direction to take.  As I stated at the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/05/25/markdown-linter-rules-headings-part-2/#what-is-next">end of the previous article</a>,
I needed to answer one important question: should I write more rules or should I fix
more issues?</p>
<p>While I did arrive at a final answer, it would eventually take me almost 2 weeks
before I was able to properly answer that question.  In addition to spending some time
to take a good look at the project, I decided to use that time to knock some of the low
priority issues off the technical debt list, hoping to gain some useful insight on
how to answer the question along the way.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commits between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/2517d271dc7b79b76683ff5cce7bb573f22fab7a">15 May 2020</a> and

<h2 id="how-did-i-get-here">How Did I Get Here?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-i-get-here" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I believe that questions such as features versus issues are important questions
for any project maintainers to ask of themselves and their project team.  Even more
important to me is the policy that any such questions and answers regarding a project
must occur with full transparency to team members and other people interested in the
project.  I know I am not the first person to get stuck on an issue like this in their
project, and I will not be the last. Because of that desire for transparency and
openness, I wanted to document how I arrived at an answer, with explanations along the
way to help others with their decisions regarding similar questions. Basically, I
consider everyone reading this article to be an honorary team member.</p>
<p>As I alluded to in the introduction, most of my articles start off as ideas that I
get while I am working on the project.  When I am trying to figure out the direction
that
I want to go with on the project, I consider both my ability to code and test any
changes along with how I am going to document those changes in an article.  By the
time the end of the “project week” starts to roll around, I have usually started to
transition from having an idea of where I want the project to go, into a plan of what
to do for the project in the next week, and how I will write the article about the
execution of the plan the week after.</p>
<p>When I get to the last day of the week, three things happen one after the other.
First, I perform a small project retrospective to figure out what parts
of the last week went well, and where I can improve, being as honest with myself as
I can.  Secondly, I scan over my commits and notes from that week and come up with a
good unifying theme for that week’s outline and sketch out a very rough outline for
the future article.  If things went well, that theme matches
the project direction from a week before.  If not, I just adjust as I go.  Finally,
I use both of those pieces of information to compose a plan on what needs to be done
in the next week with respect to the project.</p>
<p>I have found this process very healthy as it asks three very important questions for
the project. How did you do? What did you do? What do you plan to do?  More
specifically, by asking the questions in that order, my plan for the next week can
be an informed plan, incorporating any “where can I improve” action items into the
next weeks work, while they are still fresh from the retrospective.</p>
<h2 id="where-did-this-process-fall-apart">Where Did This Process Fall Apart?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-did-this-process-fall-apart" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The current issue that I had with this process started when I asked myself the rules
versus issues
question because of one of those retrospectives.  I remember sitting down at my
desk, starting to type out a couple of notes to myself as part of my retrospective.
There were two main
themes that were a part of that retrospective.  What went well was the writing of the
rules and my belief that I had developed the right framework.  What needed improving
was that my confidence in the framework was at a high level, but was it was high enough
for me to continue developing rules?  I did not feel comfortable moving forward
on the project without answering that question. But after a long period of time, I
had not made any progress on answering it.  I silently hoped that moving on to my next
task would help.</p>
<p>Despite my hope, skipping to creating a rough outline of that week’s work did not help
me to answer that question either.  The prior few weeks had all been about proving that
I had done
enough work on the project that linting rules were both possible and easy to write.  I
sincerely believed that I have succeeded with that goal with room to spare.  Mission
achieved!
But with that important question solidly answered in the positive, it did not help
me move forward on answering the question on whether the project would benefit
more from more rules or less issues.</p>
<p>I then tried to force the issue by coming up with a plan for the next week, hoping it
would
jar something in my head that would “magically” resolve the issues I had with the
retrospective and outline.  It did not work. I just sat there and paused for a long time
while staring at the screen.  I tried bouncing between the retrospective, the outline,
and the planning, but the results did not change.  I was at a bit of an impasse.
As far as I could figure, the scales seemed equally balanced.  If the questions had to
do with some manner of data-driven metric, it would have been easy for me to come up
with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go/no_go">go-no-go</a>
threshold that I could rely on.  This decision was not going to be data-driven, but
emotion-driven.  That would make the go-no-go decision a lot more difficult to pin
down to an answer that I felt good with.</p>
<p>After making a good-faith effort to arrive at an answer, I decided to choose neither
answer.
Instead, I decided to do two things.  The first thing was to take a good look at the
code over a few days, hoping to get extra insight as to where I felt the project
was and how to better answer that question.  The second thing was to fix some low-level
issues that I had noticed and wanted to address.  Nothing too earth-shattering, just
some small cleanup issues that never seemed to get picked up in one of the
other refactoring efforts.  I hoped that this two-pronged approach would help me to pick
up some other information that would tip the scales one way or the other.</p>
<p>In my mind, while it was not much of a plan, it was moving forward.  It was taking a
step forward in the hope of getting more information.  At the very least, the project
would benefit by a few issues being removed from the technical debt list.  That
was level of success criteria for the week that was lower that I was used to, but I
was fine with it.  That is, if I figured out how to properly answer that question!</p>
<h2 id="taking-time-is-not-taking-it-easy">Taking Time Is Not Taking It Easy<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-time-is-not-taking-it-easy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While it is true that I have written every line of code in the project
so far, I rarely have time to take a step back and see how things all fit together.  To
quote a professor of mine from university:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you cannot see the forest because the trees get in the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was looking through the code, I was taking notes, mostly questions for myself.
In all honesty, a couple of them were “does this really work?” which I resolved to
answer for myself by the end of the week.  Most of them though were simply me
wondering out loud if there was a better way to do something or whether I could
change something in a function to make it more readable or maintainable.</p>
<p>In the end, as would befit my university professor, I think I was better able to see
both the forest and the trees after those couple of days.  But while I had hoped that
it would nudge me one way or the other in answering my main question, I remained
at an impasse.  I was able to answer all the questions I had asked myself as I was
looking
through the code, but none of those answers signified that I had done something wrong.
They only suggested small improvements on how I wrote the code.  By no means were any
of those answers better enough to tip the scales.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-issues">Fixing Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-issues" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With one of my two paths not providing any information to sway the answer either way,
it was time to switch to the second path: fixing issues.</p>
<h3 id="better-logging-command-line-support">Better Logging Command Line Support<a class="headerlink" href="#better-logging-command-line-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the first things on my “never got around to it”<sup id="fnref:roundTuit"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:roundTuit">1</a></sup> list was to make sure
that PyMarkdown has proper command line logging support.  This level of logging
support was already available through the test framework but adding that same support
to the command line support seemed to always get pushed off.  It was time to change
that.</p>
<p>Adding that support was extremely simple, especially since I have added support like
this to many command line programs.  From experience, the two parts to adding this
feature are adding the ability to control the default log level and adding the ability
to redirect any logs that are produced to a file.</p>
<p>The actual core code to implement this feature was just 7 lines long, with the
interpretation of the command line arguments being the bulk of this change.  The
existing interpretation code, to handle command line argument parsing through the
<code>argparse</code> library, was changed to include support for the
<code>--log-level</code> and <code>--log-file</code> options, including a default setting of <code>CRITICAL</code> for
the log level.  To round out these changes, the <code>log_level_type</code> function was added to
verify that any specified log level is a valid log level.</p>
<p>Those 7 core lines to add the logging itself may change from language to language, but
they almost always are simple modifications of a common pattern.  The first part of
that pattern is dealing with
writing to the console.  As many logging frameworks will do this by default, the
customization here is to ensure that the desired logging level is applied to the
console log handler.  The second
part of that pattern is to add support for logging to a log file, usually requiring 2
to 3 discrete actions to customize the file logging to the proper settings for the
application.  As these are the two most frequently used logging modes
for command line programs, most languages include good solid templates on how to add
this for that specific language.</p>
<p>The fun part for me is always in making sure that a change like this is tested properly,
and this was not an exception.  As this is a new set of command line options, existing
tests that listed existing command line options were updated.  Additional tests were
added to <code>test_main.py</code> to specifically test the new options, including tests
specifically around specifying invalid options.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it felt good to have this issue taken care of as much as I felt like
I should have got to this one before that moment.  Being such of a core fixture
in other command line applications I have written, I just felt like this should have
been addressed a lot sooner.  Still, it was good to get it out of the way.</p>
<h3 id="better-logging-support">Better Logging Support<a class="headerlink" href="#better-logging-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This change was a small-ish change, but it was one that I was overdue to explore.  Back
at the start of May, in my article on
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/05/04/markdown-linter-core-pre-rule-improvements/#side-note">pre-rule improvements</a>
I noted that while I might be able to get away with a single static logger variable
at the top of my modules, I had not seen any good documentation on the “right” way
to do it.  When I looked at various examples, such as
<a href="https://pythonspot.com/logging/">this example</a>
at Python Spot, the examples seemed to always show logging within a single module
application, and not within a multiple module application like PyMarkdown. As such,
I decided to add localized <code>logger</code> variables until I could do some
research and figure out the proper way to add logging to each module.</p>
<p>It was not until I got the time to do more thorough research that I was able to find a
good example of how to log with multiple modules.  While the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html">Python logging docs</a>
has a good section on “Logging from multiple modules”, it was actually the section
titled
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#advanced-logging-tutorial">Advanced Logging Tutorial</a>
that gave me the information I was looking for.  While not an example, the guidance that
is given near the top of this section is quite clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good convention to use when naming loggers is to use a module-level logger, in each module which uses logging, named as follows:</p>
<p><code>Python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)</code></p>
<p>This means that logger names track the package/module hierarchy, and it’s intuitively obvious where events are logged just from the logger name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes!  After searching for some clear guidance for weeks on this, I finally found
something that was both authoritative and definitive.  Even more, the last sentence
contained a good, solid explanation of why this process should be followed.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, this change took very little time.  Instead of having a
logger instance declared as <code>logger</code> within various classes and static methods, a new
instance <code>LOGGER</code> was created at the top of each file per the instructions quoted above.
The change from <code>logger</code> to <code>LOGGER</code> was a simple search-and-replace tasks for each
file, quickly accomplished.  The hard part here was removing any <code>logger</code> arguments
that were being passed into functions in favor of the <code>LOGGER</code> instance declared at the
top of the file. Testing was also simple, as all I had to do was execute all of the
tests again, and make sure I did not miss anything.</p>
<p>It felt good to get this one off the issues list and committed to the repository.
If I had to guess, I think this one never made it into any of my refactoring lists
because things were
working okay, with no loss functionality in PyMarkdown because of it.  At the
same time, there was this persistent nagging when looking at the issues list that I
really need to figure out the “right” way to do this… and now I know what that is.</p>
<p>But did this help me figure out the answer to my question? Nope.  Taking some time
to go back and look at my half-written notes, I was still at that same impasse.
Nothing had changed.  Hopefully, that would soon change.</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-the-parsing-of-whitespace-in-setext-tokens">Adjusting the Parsing of Whitespace in SetExt Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#adjusting-the-parsing-of-whitespace-in-setext-tokens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Like the other issues that I addressed at this time, the effort to address
this issue was small. Found during the development of
<a href="rule-3.md#rule-md023-headings-must-start-at-the-beginning-of-the-line">rule MD023</a>,
this was a rare case where I felt that code added to a rule could
have been positioned better in the core framework.  While the added code in the rule was
only a small amount of code, it was a case where I knew a better way of handling this
whitespace was possible, as it was already being done for the related Paragraph token.</p>
<p>The two tokens that the SetExt heading token is related to are the Atx heading token
and the Paragraph token.  The SetExt heading token is related to the Atx heading token
in that they are both heading tokens.  The SetExt heading token is related to the
Paragraph token as a SetExt
token is created by changing an eligible Paragraph token with SetExt markings after it
into a SetExt token.  As such, when I wrote the code for rule MD023, I was surprised
that the logic for detecting whitespace at the start of a Paragraph token was trivial
but the similar logic for a SetExt token was more involved.</p>
<p>Digging into why those tokens were handled differently, I quickly determined that it
was only a couple of small changes that separated the handling of those two tokens.
Addressing these differences required a few simple changes during the coalesce
phase and the
inline processing phase, both ensuring that the processing afforded to Paragraph tokens
was also being applied to its kindred SetExt tokens.  That was immediately followed up
by adding a
couple of tests to make sure this change stuck, and then by a change to rule MD023 to
make use of a more trivial calculation of leading whitespace.</p>
<p>Looking back at my notes while I am writing this article, I believe this was the start
of me mentally tipping the scales towards spending time working on the issues.  While
this was not a big change, I believe that it represented a larger set of smaller things
that I wanted to get right before moving on.  I believe the change that was occurring
was a subtle change in how I was weighing the various categories of issues.</p>
<p>That weighing was starting to put more emphasis on fixing issues, specifically issues
with the parser.  The previous two issues that were addressed, both dealing with
logging, did not seem to affect my decision at all.  This issue, dealing with the
parser, moved the weighing enough that I noticed it.  While it was only barely
noticeable at this point, that feeling was going to get stronger as I addressed
the next issue.</p>
<h3 id="properly-grouping-hard-line-break-whitespace">Properly Grouping Hard Line Break Whitespace<a class="headerlink" href="#properly-grouping-hard-line-break-whitespace" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the things that I noticed when fixing the previous issue was that where
hard line breaks were concerned, they did not have any leading whitespace embedded
within them.  It was not a big issue. If I was not looking at the test cases
for the previous issue, I would not have seen this issue.  It was just silently
waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>It may seem like a small thing, but I have a “rule” that any whitespace before any
non-text token goes with the token that follows it.  Just before I started
writing rules, I noticed that many of the tokens were following this rule, so
I decided to apply this pattern as a blanket rule over  all the tokens.  The benefit
to this approach is that I have a consistent expectation of where the leading
whitespace will be placed after it is extracted.  That benefit allows me to write
better, more consistent rules where I always know where to look for that whitespace.</p>
<p>The fix for this issue was almost trivial.  For the most part, it was adding another
parameter to the <code>HeadBreakMarkdownToken</code> constructor, passing it either the
line continuation character <code>\</code> or the leading whitespace that caused the hard line
break to occur.  A bit of cleaning up with the resultant variables, and it was done.
But as with the previous issue, I could feel the weighing of my priorities changing.
This was another small thing, so small that it went undetected until I chanced upon
it.  But the thing was, it started me thinking: If I was able to find this issue, what
other issues were lurking in the parser, waiting to be discovered?</p>
<h3 id="consistently-using-the-word-heading">Consistently Using the Word “Heading”<a class="headerlink" href="#consistently-using-the-word-heading" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While I was very aware that this was a non-code related task, I felt that it was a good
time to get it out of the way.  During my documentation of
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/05/11/markdown-linter-rules-the-first-three/#a-quick-aside">the first three rules</a>,
I decided to choose “heading” of “header” for the reasons outlined in
that article.  However, even though I had made that change in my articles<sup id="fnref:notThat"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:notThat">2</a></sup>,
I had not
made the accompanying changes in the PyMarkdown source.</p>
<p>This was a quick search-and-replace, followed by running of tests to make sure things
were good.  Experiencing no bumps and no typos, everything went fine.  While purely
cosmetic, it felt good to make sure that the blog and the source code were in sync
with each other.  Making sure they were in sync just felt good.</p>
<h3 id="removing-setextheadingendmarkdowntoken">Removing <code>SetExtHeadingEndMarkdownToken</code><a class="headerlink" href="#removing-setextheadingendmarkdowntoken" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I have long since got rid of the notes I used during the early days of writing the
parser for PyMarkdown, so any attempt at figuring out why I added this class near the
start of the project on 29 January 2020 is probably going to fail.  My best guess, based
on what I can see in the GitHub repository, is that perhaps I believed that having a
specific end token for each start token type was the way to go.  Regardless, since that
time I have adopted an approach with a single <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> that refers to its
starting <code>MarkdownToken</code> by name.  This approach has proven to be quite practical as
most of the operations that rely on <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> instances do not need any
contextual information except for the starting tokens’s name.  As such, the
practicality of having a specific
<code>EndMarkdownToken</code> instance that matches each start Markdown token feels overpowered to
me, with little benefits to show for the added complexity.</p>
<p>Removing this token was easy.  The class was removed from the <code>markdown_token.py</code> module
and the <code>leaf_block_processor.py</code> module was changed to add an <code>EndMarkdownToken</code>
instance for the related SetExt heading.  The rest of the changes in the commit for this
change were holdovers from the previous changes, where I had forgot to do a
clean build and record the changes.</p>
<p>This change was cosmetic, but like other issues detailed in this article, it changed
the weighing of the issues even more.  Once again, the change was not a dramatic one,
but it was enough that at this point, it was noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-choice">What Was My Choice?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-choice" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having addressed a good handful of small issues that did not make the big lists for
refactorings, the balance between the two scales had shifted enough that I knew that
I had a good solid answer: fix more issues.  I did not feel that I would be wrong in
adding more rules, just that I wanted to focus on ensuring that a number of the smaller
issues were given some focus to ensure they were resolved properly.  It also did not
feel like I had lost any confidence in writing rules, that was still at a healthy level.</p>
<p>In the end, I believe it came down to a solid understanding that if I was going to
write more rules with this framework, I wanted to make sure that any obvious issues
were dealt with.  The largest of those issues that needed to be addressed was adding
the proper line number and column number support to the tokens.  But it also meant
working through the issues that I found during the first 12 rules and either verifying
they are issues and addressing them or explaining why they were okay.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I strongly believe that the process of taking my time and working through those low
priority issues gave me some valuable insight into the project that I had missed
before.  While the primary catalyst for being able to properly answer the question
were the parser issues that I resolved, I do not discount the insights provided by
looking at the source code at a higher level than usual.  I believe that by allowing
myself time to absorb the project code at a higher level, it opened some doors in my
mind that allowed me to be better influenced by the issues I fixed.  I cannot prove
that of course, but as with all feelings, it just is.</p>
<p>And while it was initially irritating that I could not answer the features versus
issues question, I now believe it was inevitable.  Especially since I am the only
one working on this project, I do not have anyone to remind me to stop looking at
the trees and focus on the forest.  That change in perspective really helped me to
get a clearer picture, and for that reminder, I am grateful.</p>
<p>One thing that I did not expect was that the answering of this question taking almost
2 weeks.  I started the planning for this block of work on 02 May and it was 16 May
before I had the planning in place for the next block of work.  The thing is, at no
time during the process did I want to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing">timebox</a>
this process.  It took 2 weeks because that is what I needed to properly answer this
question.  And I was fine with that.</p>
<p>For the large part, I am also okay with spending some time making sure I get the
parser right before moving on to authoring more rules.  Sure, it means I am extending
the development cycle out by at least a couple of weeks, but I think that the time
will be well spent.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having answered the question of rules vs foundation, it was time to tackle one of the
big issues that I had listed: line numbers and column numbers.  I knew this was not
going to be an easy change, but that just told me I should make sure I do it right the
first time!</p>
