<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/06/15/markdown-linter-rabbit-hole-1-adding-consistency-checks/">last article</a>,
I talked about starting to add consistency checks for the line/column numbers by
adding simple line number checks.  In this article, I document the work that I
performed to add column checks to the project in a similar fashion to.  While I would
like to say that the required effort was simple and the work was quickly accomplished,
as the title of the article implies, there were issues along the way that I could have
handled better.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/06/15/markdown-linter-rabbit-hole-1-adding-consistency-checks/#adding-in-more-line-number-checks">end of the last article</a>,
I talked about how I felt that the right move at that time was to move from the basic
consistency checking of line numbers to adding  a similar level
of checks for column
numbers.  My main argument for switching was that, from experience, it was
easier to track the line numbers when I manually verified the line/column numbers
than it was to track the column numbers.</p>
<p>For line numbers, unless it was a list block
or a block quote block, a new block always meant a new line, which was easy to keep
track of.  For those two container blocks,
I had to check to see if a new block followed the container block, but the calculation
was still relatively simple.</p>
<p>The calculation of column numbers was more detailed, and therefore more difficult
for me to accurately
calculate on-the-fly.  If not contained within a list block or a block quote block, I
looked at the whitespace at the start of the token and adjusted the column based
on the amount of whitespace.  If it was within a container block, I looked at the amount
of indent imparted by the container block and adjusted from there.  And while these
calculations may seem straightforward and easy, I initially double and triple checked
these values before moving on.  Even then, when I was checking the consistency of the
line numbers, I know that I got a decent handful of column numbers wrong.</p>
<p>In the end, after getting some proper perspective, I believe that the
situation became an easy one to resolve.  I had the
easy cases for line numbers done, and that was good enough for a while.  I needed to get
the column numbers to a confidence level where I felt comfortable going back to the
line numbers and finishing off those checks.  Even though I was nervous about the
mistakes that I would find, I buckled down and started to work.</p>

<h2 id="in-case-you-did-not-notice">In Case You Did Not Notice<a class="headerlink" href="#in-case-you-did-not-notice" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the dates in the previous section, the duration between the start of the
column number work and the end of the column number work was 12 days.  To be clear,
this was not all the column number work, just the easy parts of the column numbers.
The batch of work documented in this article took a lot longer than my normal 5-day
to 7-day work time.</p>
<p>It was for reasons like this situation that I named the articles in this part of the
series as “rabbit hole” articles.  Using that term at work a lot, it was amusing to
looking around for a good definition of what “rabbit hole” really means.  After some
fun research, I settled on this specific part of the article at
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/rabbit-hole/">dictionary.com’s slang dictionary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as Kathryn Schulz observed for The New Yorker in 2015, rabbit hole has further evolved in the information age: “These days…when we say that we fell down the rabbit hole, we seldom mean that we wound up somewhere psychedelically strange. We mean that we got interested in something to the point of distraction—usually by accident, and usually to a degree that the subject in question might not seem to merit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That really does capture what happened here.  But I do not want to spoil the story too
much.  Just continue reading and keep this in mind.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-simple-to-start">Keeping It Simple to Start<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-it-simple-to-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As with all good tales, the work started off with good intentions.  As stated above, I
simply wanted to replicate for column numbers, the extra confidence that I achieved
with line numbers.  To that extent, the first stipulation that I made was that, if
possible, I was going to leave the container blocks until later.  Container
blocks were going to easily make things more confusing, so leaving them out would free
my mind up to concentrate solely on the leaf blocks.
While I was not sure what impact that rule would make, I hoped that it would reduce
the large amount of work that I was anticipating.</p>
<h2 id="taking-time-to-come-up-with-a-plan">Taking Time to Come Up With A Plan<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-time-to-come-up-with-a-plan" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With container block tokens (via the previous section) and inline tokens (as noted in
previous articles) excluded, I was able to concentrate all my effort on the leaf blocks.
While it was tempting to dive right into the work and to “clean everything up”, I knew
that I needed more of a plan than “clean everything up”
or “check all leaf blocks”.  I needed to take a good survey of the existing tokens and
their resultant HTML and determine what the intent of the token is and how it translates
into HTML.</p>
<p>How did I know to do that?  When I was going through the different scenario tests while
implementing the consistency checks for
the line numbers, I noticed that there seemed to be 2 different classes of column
numbers for leaf tokens: one class where the whitespace occurs before the token and one
class where the whitespace seems to be part of the token.  It took a bit of research
and looking again at the tests, but I did verify that there were at least 2 classes of
leaf tokens.</p>
<p>Confused?  Let me help!</p>
<h3 id="organizing-classes-of-blocks-by-their-intent">Organizing Classes of Blocks By Their Intent<a class="headerlink" href="#organizing-classes-of-blocks-by-their-intent" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fenced code blocks are blocks where any whitespace that occurs before the token is
recorded in the token, placing it solidly in the <code>before</code> class.  Looking at the
Markdown for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-105">example 105</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">```</span>
<span class="n">aaa</span>
  <span class="o">```</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and the Markdown for <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-106">example 106</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="o">```</span>
<span class="n">aaa</span>
  <span class="o">```</span>
</pre></div>
<p>in the GFM specification, both fenced code block Markdown fragments produce the exact
same HTML output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>aaa
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that any whitespace before the code block starts is removed and does not appear in
the output.  While I need to add that whitespace back in to validate the column numbers
properly, it makes no difference to the HTML that is output.  As all the whitespace
occurs before the token itself starts, I decided to call this class of leaf blocks
the <code>before</code> class.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-86">example 86</a>
shows Markdown text for an indented code block:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="n">foo</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span>
</pre></div>
<p>that produces the following HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>    foo
bar
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this case, the indented code block is more aware of the whitespace that occurs
before the block starts, putting it firmly in the <code>contains</code> class.  Specifically,
this class of blocks is for any leaf block where the whitespace makes up even a small
part of the block itself.  This is obvious with this block as the whitespace starts
at column 1 but continues in the produced HTML within the <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> block.</p>
<p>To prove that these leaf blocks are in the correct classes, I replicated the above
examples, but deleted a single space character from the initial whitespace for each
code block.  That change did not make any difference to the fenced code block, but
that change precipitated the removal of one space character from the HTML output for
the indented code block.  Due to that simple behavior, it was simple to place every leaf
block type into one of the two classes, allowing the blocks to be mostly handled as a
group of blocks instead of as individual blocks.</p>
<h3 id="aside">Aside<a class="headerlink" href="#aside" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To keep things above board, there technically is a third class, but it is mostly hidden.
In the case of blank lines and link reference definitions, the actual HTML output for
both elements is that they are ignored.  Therefore, technically the third class is for
<em>ignored</em> tokens, but for the purposes of this classification, I assume they are in
neither class.</p>
<h3 id="classifying-the-blocks">Classifying the Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#classifying-the-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With that newly acquired information in mind, I walked through similar examples and
assigned each of the leaf tokens to one of these three classes: before, contains, or
ignored.</p>
<ul>
<li>thematic breaks: before, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-17">example 17</a></li>
<li>atx headings: before, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-38">example 38</a></li>
<li>setext headings: before, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-54">example 54</a></li>
<li>indented code block: contains, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-86">example 86</a></li>
<li>fenced code block: before, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-106">example 106</a></li>
<li>HTML block: contains, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-120">example 120</a></li>
<li>link reference definition: ignored, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-162">example 162</a></li>
<li>paragraphs: before, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-192">example 192</a></li>
<li>blank lines: ignored, but treated as contains, see <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-197">example 197</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keeping-things-consistent">Keeping Things Consistent<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-things-consistent" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In looking at how whitespace was handled for each of the leaf block tokens, one thing
did indeed stand out: I was not storing whitespace for each of the tokens in the token
itself.  While it was being passed down to the base class, there was not an explicit
variable named <code>extracted_whitespace</code> for each token that stored this information.
Some tokens had that variable, some did not.</p>
<p>While I could calculate this information on a token by token basis, it seemed simpler
to add the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to each of the constructors that were not assigning the argument to a member variable.
Specifically, the tokens for block quotes, list starts, indented code blocks, html
blocks, and thematic breaks needed this change, and it was a very quick change to
perform.  The important thing about this change was that, going forward, each of the
non-ignored tokens contained a
variable that explicitly was there to contain any extracted whitespace.  As this
variable was now in most block tokens, I hoped that the group of tokens could now be
processed largely as one group, instead of 11 distinct block tokens.</p>
<h2 id="player-enter-rabbit-hole-level-1">Player, Enter Rabbit Hole Level 1<a class="headerlink" href="#player-enter-rabbit-hole-level-1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I implemented the column numbers to begin with, I honestly thought there was only
one class of tokens, and therefore I treated them all as if they were in the <em>before</em>
class.  To that extent, when I calculated each of the column numbers for the leaf
tokens, I started with the number 1 at the first position in the line and incremented
by 1 for each space character present in the data.  Effectively, I used the formula:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">column_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>But now that I knew there was also a <em>contains</em> class, it meant adjusting the formula
slightly.  Additionally, based on further observations, it looked like the HTML blocks
and the indented code blocks were going to need slightly different formulas.</p>
<p>HTML blocks were the easiest one to observe and determine the pattern for.  Based on
the Markdown from
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-120">example 120</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">hello</span><span class="o">*</span>
         <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>it was obvious to me that the Markdown produces output that is exactly what is
contained within the block, namely:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  *hello*
         <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">foo</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">a</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Based on the transformation, an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_transform">identity transformation</a>
to be exact, it made sense that the formula for HTML blocks is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">column_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The reasoning for this simple calculation is based on the observation of the transformed
HTML.  As any text that is part of the Markdown HTML block is part of the resultant
HTML, I interpreted that to mean that the block itself starts at the start of the line,
hence a column number of 1.</p>
<p>Following a similar line of investigation, I looked at a good example of an indented
code block, the Markdown for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-86">example 86</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="n">foo</span>
    <span class="n">bar</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and its resultant HTML:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>    foo
bar
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Based on this transformation, after the first 4 spaces are removed from the start of
each line, those lines are inserted into the HTML output, with a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>
around them.
As the first 4 spaces are removed from each line, they are effectively part of the
token, but in a weird way.  In the above example, the first 4 spaces are swallowed while
the remaining spaces are left intact.  Based on this behavior, I interpreted that to
mean that the block itself starts after the 4th space, even though there are more spaces
before the non-space text starts.  Given that, the formula is:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>but with a special provision that any unused text is added to the start of the text
token that follows the indented code block token.</p>
<p>Now that I had the behavior down, it was on to implementing the code for the
consistency check.</p>
<h2 id="congratulations-player-now-enter-rabbit-hole-level-2">Congratulations Player, Now Enter Rabbit Hole Level 2<a class="headerlink" href="#congratulations-player-now-enter-rabbit-hole-level-2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having a solid idea of the behavior that I expected from each <em>contains</em> token and the
group of <em>begins</em> tokens, it was time to write the consistency check.
To allow for an easy computation of what the initial positioning was, I created
the <code>__calc_initial_whitespace</code> function, starting it off with the equivalent
of:<sup id="fnref:every"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:every">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__calc_initial_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="sb">`every token`</span> <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">indent_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>By isolating all the various formula into one function, I was to be able to
use this simple code to implement the check itself:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">init_ws</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">__calc_initial_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">current_token</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">current_position</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index_number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">init_ws</span>
</pre></div>
<h3 id="fixing-the-easy-failures">Fixing the Easy Failures<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-the-easy-failures" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After running the scenario tests with this new code in place, there were a lot of
successes,
but also failures that I needed to deal with.  The first set of failures
was with
various tokens that did not have a properly implemented <code>extracted_whitespace</code> member
variable: HTML blocks,
blank lines, and SetExt headings.</p>
<p>The HTML blocks were the easiest to deal with, as the formula from the previous section
always returns a column number of 1.  I added code to always return an index of 0 for
the length of the initial whitespace, resulting in a column position of 1 once the
above code was applied.  From there, blank lines were equally easy. While there are
good arguments for having blank lines denote the start or the end of the line, I picked
the start of the line to keep things simple. This made the coding easy, as these tokens
ended up returning 0, the same value as for HTML blocks.</p>
<p>That left an oddball: SetExt headings.  For some reason that is lost to me, SetExt
headings use the <code>remaining_line</code> member variable instead of
<code>extracted_whitespace</code>.  While it felt weird, it was easy to do a quick check for that,
returning the length of that variable when SetExt headings tokens were encountered.
I also added an issue to my list to check this out in the future, as it is an
unnecessary complication that does not add any benefit.</p>
<p>Running that scenario tests again, most of the issues were dealt with easily, following
the above rules, and adjusting the column numbers to the newly corrected values after
additional manual verification.
It was only a small handful of
errors that showed up, mostly in the HTML block scenario tests and the indented code
block scenario tests.  As those two blocks were ones that I placed into the
<em>contains</em> class, these failures were expected and quickly addressed, applying changes
to the scenario tests to resolve those failures in short order.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs-were-a-bit-more-work">Paragraphs Were a Bit More Work<a class="headerlink" href="#paragraphs-were-a-bit-more-work" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next group of failures were easily grouped together as scenario tests that deal
explicitly with paragraphs.  On closer examination, it seemed that the failures occurred
only in a couple of specific cases.  After a couple of observations, it became obvious
that the failures were
restricted to multiline paragraphs.  In those multiline paragraphs, all the
whitespace stripped from the start of each line in the paragraph is added to the
token, not just the first line.  To address that, I made some quick changes to the code
for dealing with multiline paragraph tokens:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_paragraph</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">indent_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">indent_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">calc_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With the paragraph tokens dealt with, the column numbers now lined up nicely between
my calculated numbers and the consistency check numbers.  Other than tabs, the only
outlying scenario tests were two tests for indented code blocks inside of list blocks.</p>
<h3 id="another-rabbit-hole">Another Rabbit Hole<a class="headerlink" href="#another-rabbit-hole" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To be honest, during the writing of this article, getting a firm understanding of the
status of these two scenario tests took a couple of passes.  I had that understanding
when I completed the tests, then forgot it before I wrote the article.  When I started
to write article, I figured it out again, then forgot it while focusing on other
aspects of the article.  Finally, when I found the correct answer again, before I
forgot the explanation yet again, I quickly jotted down notes for this section.</p>
<p>Yes, column numbers can be confusing.  Keep good notes.  Trust me on this.</p>
<p>The two list block scenario tests that I had issues with were
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-235">example 235</a> and
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-252">example 252</a>.  For example 235:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="o">-</span>    <span class="n">one</span>

     <span class="n">two</span>
</pre></div>
<p>due to the extra indentation, the top paragraph starts at column number 7.  However,
as the lower paragraph does not have enough spaces to match that start column, it is
instead interpreted as an indented code block.<sup id="fnref:see236"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:see236">2</a></sup>  As such, that indented code
block starts at column 5, per established rule from above, and contains text that
starts with the 1 extra space.  As the column number in the test was 6, it was adjusted
to the now correct value of 5, with manual verification and consistency check
verification in place.  From personal experience, it was easy to forget that the
indented code block starts after the 4 space indent, making the calculation look
wrong.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-252">example 252</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>      <span class="n">indented</span> <span class="n">code</span>

   <span class="n">paragraph</span>

       <span class="k">more</span> <span class="n">code</span>
</pre></div>
<p>it was more <em>fun</em> with lists, but this time it was an unordered list that
contained a valid indented code block, unlike the example above.  In this case, the
list start sequence does not have any whitespace before it and is a simple 1 digit
list start.  From a calculation point of view, that means start with 0, add 0 to
that total for leading whitespace for the list start, 2 to that total for characters
in the list start sequence, and then add 1 to that total for the mandatory
list-to-content whitespace separator.  That means that the earliest that any content
can start in the list is at index 3, matching the list’s <code>indent_level</code> member
variable.  As the
next token is an indented code block, adding 4 to that total results in an index of 7
or a position/column of 8 where the content for the code block starts.
  As the column number in the test was 9, it was adjusted
to the now correct value of 8, with manual verification and consistency check
verification in place.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my introduction to this article, the calculation for column numbers
were more detailed.  It was not until I wrote down the formulas for the calculation,
as outlined above, that I was able to confirm that I had made the right choice.</p>
<p>And with that, all the scenario tests were passing except for tabs.</p>
<p>Yeah, tabs again.</p>
<h2 id="be-wary-player-now-enter-rabbit-hole-level-3-tabs">Be Wary Player, Now Enter Rabbit Hole Level 3: Tabs<a class="headerlink" href="#be-wary-player-now-enter-rabbit-hole-level-3-tabs" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I looked at the code, dreading a lot of changes to the code to support tabs, there
was both good
news and bad news.  The first part of the good news was that
except for the tab scenarios, the rest of the code was solid.  I had found a couple of
issues so far, but otherwise column numbers looked good.  The second part of the good
news
was that anything to fix with respect to tabs at the start of a line would be
largely restricted to the indented code blocks.  Until I started testing with container
blocks, any blocks that started with any combination of tabs and spaces would always
trigger the 4 whitespace minimum required to start an indented code block.</p>
<p>The bad news?  This was not going to be fun.   As I documented in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/27/markdown-linter-reducing-the-parsers-technical-debt/#refactor-2-more-fun-with-tabs">More Fun With Tabs</a>,
Markdown uses tab characters as tab stops.  To remove the complexity of handling those
tabs at the start of every block, I did the necessary computations to translate tab
characters into the correct number of spaces, based on the current index in the Markdown
document.  From that point on, any leading whitespace was tab-free and easy to work
with and manipulate for the transformation into HTML.</p>
<p>But then I got to validating tokens for consistency with respect to column numbers.
After clearing away all the
other failures, only 13 failures remained, and all them dealt with tabs and
specifically with tabs in indented code blocks.  How bad could it be to reverse the
change and pass the initial whitespace through?  I started working the problem.</p>
<p>Three days later, I determined that it would be very difficult.  After 2 restarts, there
was just too much code already in place to handle that relied on all leading whitespace
being space characters.
Replacing it would require more time to just get it to a good starting point, not even
to the point of having the tests passing.  Resetting for a third time, I decided to
just focus on the initial case of having a tab in the starting whitespace that caused
an indented code block.  Instead of working to reset the tab in all the code,
I focused on reconstructing the leading whitespace to determine what the proper handling
of the tab should be.</p>
<p>Another three days later, and the code was complete.  When the initial whitespace is
encountered, a check is made against the initial line to be parsed to see if that line
contains a tab.  If so, further progressing is done to extract the original whitespace
that directly corresponds to the initial whitespace that caused the indented code block
to be started.  Once the original whitespace fragment was recovered, the extracted
whitespace in the indented code block token was adjusted, placing the proper portions
of the leading whitespace in the code block token and the following text block token.
And it also provisionally supported lists and block quotes.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-i-need-to-do-this">Why Did I Need to Do This?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-did-i-need-to-do-this" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Basically, before this work, the whitespace that
was in the leaf block tokens did not have to be correct as it was largely ignored. As
such, only the extracted whitespace stored in the enclosed text block had to be
correct, as that whitespace is directly exposed when rendering the token into HTML.  To
make this more evident, consider the Markdown text for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-7">example 7</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-&lt;</span><span class="n">tab</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">tab</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">foo</span>
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> is a tab character.  As the specification explains, there is a bit of
calculation trickery in this area.  The list start character <code>-</code> must be followed by
a space, so when the first tab character is encountered, 2 spaces must be emitted to
replace the tab stop.  When the next tab character is encountered, we are already at
a tab stop, so that tab is replaced with 4 characters, for a total initial whitespace
of 6 characters.</p>
<p>Why was this important?  Because I had to make sure the right whitespace was being
placed in the right token, otherwise either the HTML validation would fail, or the
new consistency checks would fail.  Before this consistency check, if I
placed the needed 2 characters in the HTML text, the test passed.  Due to the check,
I now had to also properly calculate the whitespace to put in the indented code block
tokens itself.</p>
<p>As I finished up work on the changes, I looked at the calendar… and noticed that
instead of my usual one week of work, it was 12 days later.  What I had budgeted 5
days for had taken 12 days.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-went-wrong" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking back, I simply messed up. To me, there is nothing wrong with messing
up with something like this, if I learn something and grow.  So, it is just a
matter of taking a good look at what happened, and being honest with myself.</p>
<p>The big thing that happened is that I believe that when I saw that it was going to
be a lot of additional work to support tabs, I should have stopped to re-evaluate
what needed to be done.  Instead, I kept on pressing forward instead of evaluating
whether tabs were worth it at that time.  As I personally do not use tabs, and many
of the documents that I surveyed do not have tabs in them, I could have sidelined tabs
for another day.</p>
<p>In addition, once I started to work on implementing the proper tab support for the
tokens, I ignored additional warning signs.  Thinking back, I believe that I
kept on thinking “just around the next corner” and “one more line”, instead of being
honest about the work.  Essentially, I let my pride get in the way.  Instead of
being okay with leaving a partially implemented solution or resetting the work, I
was convinced that it was just another 5 minutes away… even after 5 days.</p>
<p>On top of that, I mostly ignored my rule about leaving container blocks out of the
current block of work.  To get to this point with the tabs, I had to write extra
code that is specifically in place to deal with indented code blocks within container
blocks that contain tabs in the leading whitespace.  That is doubling down on dealing
with container blocks, not leaving them for later.</p>
<p>I need to think about things.  How did I feel about all this?</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I have
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/02/10/markdown-linter-adding-html-blocks/#changing-the-narrative">mentioned before</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stuff happens, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and figure out what to do next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I messed up.  Stuff happened.  Instead of doing what I normally do, I went down
the rabbit hole
and got lost in trying to get the column numbers right, not just “good enough”. Even
after I started implementing the tab support, I did not pay attention to my own
warning signs that were telling me to reset and regroup.</p>
<p>As for the dusting myself off, I realized that there was some good news out of all
this work.  Good news from all this? Really?</p>
<p>The biggest part of the good news is this is the first time that this kind of thing
has happened on this project.  Yeah, I was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfocus">hyperfocused</a>
on getting the
work done, and did not pay attention to anything else.  But unlike other projects where
this happened multiple times throughout the same project, this was the first time for
this project.  One instance of this for a project that has lasted 8 months… not bad!
This is not just me making
<a href="https://www.idiomeanings.com/make-lemonade-out-of-lemons/">lemons out of lemonade</a>,
I was genuinely happy.  Granted, it took me a bit of self-reflection to get there,
but I got there.</p>
<p>And on the way there, I did notice things.  One thing that I am confident about is that
even though having to take this route
with the tab characters is painful, it would have been more painful to have to deal
with those tabs in multiple places.  The current implementation for leading whitespace
removes the tabs, only adding them back in for the few cases where they are needed.
Another thing is that although I needed to address a couple of issues with 2 classes
of leaf blocks, the calculations for the column numbers were mostly spot on.  I still
want to make sure remain consistent by having consistency checks, but I am more
confident that I calculated the column numbers correctly.</p>
<p>Sure, I got distracted.  It happens to everyone, especially with projects that we are
all passionate about.  I sincerely wanted to do the right thing, and that is not bad,
just counterproductive at this time.  Right now, I need “good enough”, not “perfect”.
While this was indeed a setback, it was a relatively small setback, one that I can
easily recover from.</p>
<p>Overall, I was a bit bruised from following tabs down the rabbit hole, but I was
okay with it.  Not proud of it, but also not blaming myself and flogging myself for
it either.  Just okay with it.  And while I did go overboard, I did get the initial
scope of work done.  In the end, all is good.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After focusing a lot of time on went wrong, it took a bit for me to realize that the
consistency checks were working as planned.  But on further examination, with possible
influence from my issues with hyperfocusing, I decided that I was not yet at the
point where I could switch back to line numbers.  As such, my next article will talk
about how I continued this work verifying column numbers.</p>
