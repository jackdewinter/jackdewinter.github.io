<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/01/10/markdown-linter-know-when-to-break-the-rules/">last article</a>, I talked
about finding a process that works for yourself.  In this article, I talk about
continuing to make progress on testing nested containers.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It took me a while to get this latest round of scenario tests added and passing,
but it was worth getting them added into the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown project</a>.
I have known that nested
container elements have been a concern of mine for a while, so it is nice to be
able to finally start addressing it.  Even if it did take a couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>

my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between

<h2 id="the-long-haul-issue-227">The Long Haul: <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/227">Issue 227</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-long-haul-issue-227" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The concept itself is simple, but the testing and debugging of the first set of
scenarios for this are far from simple.  The concept of this issue is to take
every combination of three-level deep Markdown containers, and make sure that they
all parse properly at their maximum distances.</p>
<p>What does that mean?  Picked at random, the test function <code>test_nested_three_block_block_ordered</code>
contains the following Markdown document:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="n">item</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This example could be taken out of the <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>
specification for its simplicity.  It is simply an Ordered List element within a
Block Quote element within another Block Quote element.  Each bit of spacing between
each container element and the next element is done according to normal standards.</p>
<p>But in the real world, things are not always standard.  There is an optional space
character that follows the Block Quote character (<code>&gt;</code>) and a required space character
that follows the Ordered List sequence (<code>1.</code>).  At that point, to allow for different
expressions of the document, up to three space characters can be provided.</p>
<p>While I was not able to find any reason why three or less space characters are
okay, but four or more space characters is an indented code block, my guess is because
of the tab character.  Putting aside that the tab character is interpreted as a
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#tabs">Tab Stop</a> rather than four straight space
characters, it looks like Indented Code Block elements were prefaced with four
space characters, or a non-justified tab character, because it was easy.  The
way I think about it is this.  If you want to create an Indented Code Block element
outside of any container, simply use a tab character or its equivalent of four
space characters.</p>
<p>But as I am about to show, that does add in some complexities to nested container
elements.</p>
<h3 id="indented-text-works-up-to-a-point">Indented Text Works… Up To A Point<a class="headerlink" href="#indented-text-works-up-to-a-point" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To see this indented behavior in action, run this Markdown document through any GitHub
Flavored Markdown compliant
Markdown parser, such as <a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/?text=1.+zero+spaces%0A1.++one+space%0A1.+++two+spaces%0A1.++++three+spaces%0A1.+++++four+spaces">BabelMark</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">zero</span> <span class="n">spaces</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>  <span class="n">one</span> <span class="k">space</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>   <span class="n">two</span> <span class="n">spaces</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>    <span class="n">three</span> <span class="n">spaces</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>     <span class="n">four</span> <span class="n">spaces</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Except for the English name for the number of spaces after the start
of the List element, the first four lines each translate neatly into a simple text element
within a List Item HTML element.  Once four spaces are used, as on the fifth
line, the List Item text transfers from simple Markdown text to an Indented Code
Block element.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ol</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>zero spaces<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>one space<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>two spaces<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>three spaces<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>four spaces
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ol</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While this is simple when showing these indents and their behavior when starting
from column 1, it easily gets more complicated when nested containers come into
play.  That was one of the reasons that I introduced this series of scenario tests:
the <code>max</code> series.  Starting with the Markdown document for the <code>test_nested_three_block_block_ordered</code>,
test function, I then created the document for the <code>test_nested_three_block_max_block_max_ordered_max</code>
test function, injecting three spaces between elements instead of zero spaces.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">list</span>
   <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
<p>From there, I pedantically added one extra space character to each level of that
scenario for each container element, increasing the space between container elements
from three spaces to four spaces. So, for the <code>test_nested_three_block_max_plus_one_block_max_block_max</code>
test function, I added <code>plus one</code> space character after the first Block Quote element,
resulting in a document of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">list</span>
    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">item</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once that was finished, I also went through the combinations for the other two
container elements at that level, producing the required tests for those scenarios.</p>
<p>It was not complicated, but it took a while to work through everything.  For each
of the <code>test_nested_three_</code> modules, twelve new scenarios were added to cover all
the combinations.  With nine combinations of the base two container elements, which
meant that I added ninety-six new scenario tests.  And that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>It was also interesting.  Plus-one indents at the first two levels were easy
to get working correctly, but it was the second lines that gave me the most trouble.
Making sure that the containers and indents worked together on that second line
was the bulk of the issue that I needed to fix.  But it was worth it!</p>
<h3 id="it-just-takes-time">It Just Takes Time<a class="headerlink" href="#it-just-takes-time" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Adding all those scenario tests was a chore, taking a couple of days to work
through them all.  It just took time to run through each of the ninety-six different
scenarios, verify that I had entered everything in properly, and generate the HTML
output using Babelmark.  From there, I ran each scenario test individually against
PyMarkdown, noting which scenario tests passed and which scenario tests failed.</p>
<p>In the end, just over half of the scenario tests passed, and just under half of
the scenario tests failed.  It was not the ratio that I was hoping for, but it
was the one I needed to work with.  So, little bit by little bit, I started
picking up groups of similar failures and dealing with them.</p>
<p>Two weeks after I started working on those failures, I finally had them all
passing.  It was a real mixed bag of experiences.  Some of the failures that
I looked at were resolved within a couple of hours of debugging and fixing.
Other failures took a day or two for me to just figure out the debugging
end of things, with the fixing of the issue taking just as long.  In some
cases, I was moving code from deeper within the parser code to closer to
the surface.  For others, it was adding net-new code for a situation that I did
not have to cover before.</p>
<p>And the amount of code varied as much as the location of the code and the complexity
met in figuring out what that code was.  In a couple of cases, I merely
had to ensure that a calculated value was being added to another variable in
the correct manner.  While those were nice to have, most of code fixes required
between ten and fifteen lines of new code, usually to compute a value that was
needed in another location.  And there was one case where the number of changed
lines peaked at around fifty lines.</p>
<p>As I said above, it was a real mixed bag.  But as I have said in the last
couple of articles I posted, having a good set of processes that work for
me really helped.  Often, I ended up scribbling down the Markdown
document for the scenario and working through it on paper as well as through
the code.  There are may <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/91255/how-can-i-best-display-a-blank-space-character#:~:text=Visual%20representation%20of%20spaces%20in%20text%20are%20more,impact%20of%20the%20former%20representation%20in%20most%20fonts.">Blank Characters</a>
scribbled on those pages, from a habit I picked up years ago when I started
writing parsers.  From the above link:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The symbol ␢ has a long history of use for this purpose in early computer programming. It was handwritten on coding sheets by programmers to indicate a space character to punch-card machine operators (who were like a typing pool).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure how common they are outside of my use of them in parser design, but
I find them to be invaluable for clearly writing down what is being parsed.</p>
<p>So, it was a long journey to get those scenario tests passing, but I knew
it was just a matter of time before I got there.</p>
<h3 id="still-a-bit-left-to-go">Still A Bit Left To Go<a class="headerlink" href="#still-a-bit-left-to-go" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>So there interesting thing about adding a series of combinatorically generated
scenario tests is that interesting patterns appear.  For this set of scenario
tests, I know that there are some simple tests that I am going to have to add
in the next series of scenario tests.  A good portion of them are for my own benefit,
making sure that the project is already covering scenarios that I believe are
covered.  With my solutions for a small group of third-level nesting scenario
tests, I believe that my solutions might cause a problem if extended to a fourth-level
nesting scenario.  And finally, there are a handful of scenario test variations
that I missed with the current set of scenario tests.</p>
<p>None of these issues (or possible issues) were things that I could have spotted
ahead of time.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With other things going on in life in the last couple of weeks, it sometimes was
a struggle to get some “me” time to work on the PyMarkdown project.  But with
few exceptions, it was useful time that helped me center myself.  There were a
couple of issues that I thought I would never solve.  In each case, I trusted
in my development process, took the breaks that I needed, and used a lot of paper
to scribble out possible parsing paths.  Because of my confidence in my process,
while I knew I might have difficulty figuring out how to solve the current issue,
I knew that I would get there.</p>
<p>And it was this week that led me to an interesting conclusion: this is not the
last Container Block Processor module that I am going to write.  While the last
rewrite helped me get closer to a clean implementation, this recent set of issues
has led me to believe that I still have some learning left to do.  Only once I
finish that learning will I properly be able to implement a clean parser.</p>
<p>I am okay with that.  It is probably not going to happen for at least a year,
and there is no timetable associated with it, but it will happen.  And when
I get to that point, I believe I will feel that it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But right now, it is all about finishing these nested container tests.  And I still
have work to do!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As one of the sections above noted, I have a handful of extra scenarios that
I need to take care of before moving on.  Once those are done, I will probably
release a new version of PyMarkdown, just to make sure it is current.
Stay tuned!</p>
