<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/01/10/markdown-linter-know-when-to-break-the-rules/">last article</a>, I talked
about how I had to bend or break my own rules last week.  This week, I talk about
finding a process that works for yourself.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a grueling week at work and at home.  Nothing specific, just a lot of small
stuff that had to be done and I just felt like I was hitting walls getting it done.
But amidst that
turmoil, I found comfort in being able to get deep into the occasional bit of work.
Even if it was
only for a half hour here and there, losing my mind in my own work for a while helped me relax.
And that relaxing helped me get through the week.</p>
<p>So, this week, I decided to talk about what I have found that helps me get into
that mindset, in the hope of helping others with their own journey.</p>
<h2 id="finding-your-own-groove">Finding Your Own Groove<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-your-own-groove" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Due to a lot of things happening in my personal life and professional life in the
past week, I did not get a lot done on the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.
As I have mentioned before, I need to take of my entire life, not just focus on
the one project.  And it is not like I did not get any work done this past week.
It was just the quantity of work done was a lot lower than I hoped for. And
while before that might have bothered me at one point in my life, I now realize
the fallacy of focusing too much of my life on one thing.</p>
<p>Two thing that helped me accomplish the little work that I did this week was understanding
myself and having a good groove to my coding.  I will probably do multiple articles
in the future on understanding myself, but this week I want to focus on finding
that groove.
And while I do listen to music while coding, that is not the groove I am talking
about.  Groove itself is an interesting word.  According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groove">Merriam-Webster</a>,
there are six separate definitions attributed to the word.  The two definitions
that I think are most applicable are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>top form</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the middle of the strike zone in baseball where a pitch is most easily hit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, both definitions indicate a place where something is more easily
accomplished.  When I work, be it professionally or personally, that is the
mindset I aim for: keeping my efficiency maxed out.</p>
<p>That is what a groove is about for me. Finding a groove is being able to get into
that mindset where I
can be as efficient as possible on the task that I am doing.  Maybe it is mowing
the lawn with headphones on, maybe it is loading the dishwasher with no music on,
but some tasks just work better when you get an environment set up that helps you
get the job done in what seems like no time.  It helps me get the task done, and
sometimes it also makes the time taken to perform the task seem like nothing at
all.</p>
<p>And for software development, I really have two different grooves.</p>
<h2 id="my-debugging-groove">My Debugging Groove<a class="headerlink" href="#my-debugging-groove" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I believe I have a solid groove for my debugging.  As I have mentioned in previous
articles, I prefer logging to interactive debuggers as I feel that I can see the
entire picture more clearly that way.  I will often turn on debug logging and execute
the test I am debugging to print out a very verbose log of what happened.  I typically
do so with a specific area of the Markdown translation that needs addressing, so I
quickly try and get to that area of the output.  From there, I make sure that the
logs show the relevant states that I need to see and go from there.</p>
<p>It might seem boring, but it is what my debugging grove is all about.  I start with
an okay-ish picture of what I think is going on.  My goal is to improve the resolution
of that picture to the point where I can spot the problem.  Sometimes it is obvious
and sometimes it takes a couple of hours, but it seldom fails for me.  That process
is so ingrained into my tasks that I can easily get into a groove with me, my music,
and one terminal output window laid on top of one VSCode window with source code.
I get to a place where I do not think about what I am doing, I just think and do.</p>
<p>For me, that is what works: having the data in front of me to help fill in the
gaps of the picture that I have in my head.  If I had to put some descriptions
to the style of debugging, I would probably use words like fluid and dense.  I
like a lot of organized information and the ability to move as freely as possible
through the data.  That balance of information just allows me to properly visualize
the specific debug tasks that I am undertaking.</p>
<p>Or as Jimmy Fallon might say: “That’s My Jam!”</p>
<h2 id="my-coding-groove">My Coding Groove<a class="headerlink" href="#my-coding-groove" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once I follow that path and I get to a probable reason that my code is not working the
way I want it to, that is where my coding groove comes in.  Knowing I was drafting
this article on Sunday, I saved some “groove code” that I wrote on Saturday:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Just for the record, the first sample that I pasted in this article was about four times the size of the
above text, but I trimmed it for readability.  I was okay in trimming it down
because the patterns in the removed code were just repeated patterns from the
above code.</p>
<p>And yes, I totally admit the code is ugly.  It does not describe what it is doing,
it is not nicely organized, and contains a certain amount of cut-and-paste code.
But for me, looking at that code when I am in my own groove, it makes total sense
to me.  With the current context being the task that I am working on, I focus on
what changes I need to make to the code to bring it closer to the desired end goal.</p>
<p>Would I ever check in code like this?  Nope.  But in terms of allowing me to stay
in my groove and focus on the problem at hand, it works wonders for me.  I do care
about code quality and readable code.  But none of that really matters until I can
get the code working properly.  Pretty code that is wonderfully organized just does
not matter if it does not work as intended.  Therefore, my coding process temporarily cuts
that requirement out of the picture to allow me to be more efficient.</p>
<p>If I had to try and related it to a process that most people would recognize,
I would associate my process with writing an essay the way I was taught in high
school.  The debugging phase in the last section is doing the research for the
essay.  The “groove code” above is me writing out a preface, a body, and a conclusion,
keeping things loose until I find a combination of paragraphs that echo the
research and connect properly.  Once that is done, the rest is just window dressing
to make things look good, which is what the next section is about.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-groove-is-over">After The Groove Is Over<a class="headerlink" href="#after-the-groove-is-over" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Besides sounding like a great name for a rock song, that process does leave me
with cleanup to do once I solve the problem.  I do not want to take away
the importance of this section by calling it “cleanup” or anything like that.
While the hard part is coming up with a working solution, it can also be difficult
to express that solution in a way that I will understand when I look at it
again two weeks from now.  I need to remove the code that is related into its
own function, give the function a good name, give the variables a good name,
and make sure that I will not look at it later and go “what was I thinking?”</p>
<p>As an example, the first step in cleaning up that code was to move most of it
to its own function, <code>__handle_trailing_indent_with_block_quote</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">container_depth</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">position_marker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index_number</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">have_pre_processed_indent</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">container_level_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">skip_containers_before_leaf_blocks</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">used_indent</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ContainerBlockProcessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__handle_trailing_indent_with_block_quote</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the <code>__handle_pre_processed_indent</code> function that held the earlier version of the
code, it was obvious that the new code should have its own function.  However, when
I was fixing the code, it was also obvious that keeping everything in one place
made the most sense.  But now that I went from a fixing stage to a quality stage,
the priorities shifted.  Now it was more about making sure that the change that
I made was readable and maintainable.</p>
<p>To that extent, I took some more time to provide each of the variables with a
more descriptive name of what it was doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nd">@staticmethod</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__handle_trailing_indent_with_block_quote</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">used_indent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">stack_index</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">)):</span>

<p>The variable <code>xx</code> became <code>used_indent</code>, the variable <code>i</code> became <code>stack_token</code> and
so forth.  I also ran my standard tools <code>black</code>, <code>flake8</code>, and <code>pylint</code> on the
code to make sure I was not missing anything.</p>
<p>Doing this step any earlier in the change process would have just slowed me down.
But with the changes finished and the “groove context” vanishing from my mind, it
was the right time to capture that information and reorganize.  Capture that
context in the naming of the objects as best as I can, and make it look neat.</p>
<p>As a friend of mine once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leave it cleaner that you found it for the next developer.  Because remember, that next developer will probably be you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-readers">What Does This Mean For Readers?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-this-mean-for-readers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I have said in other articles about process, this is the process that works for
me and make me produce the best work.  There really is not guide that says, “if your
name is Jack, then this is the way you developer software”.  I have found that I
get little bit of insights from here and there, with more experimentation than
success.  But even little insights and experiments, whether the outcome is positive
or negative, helps me tune my process that much more.</p>
<p>So, for any readers that are looking to improve their process, while I would like
to give each reader their own guide to developing at their most efficient: it is
up to you.  Read articles and see if something that another developer describes
in their process speaks to you.  Look at other aspects of your life and see if
you can transplant things that work in those aspects into your development
process.</p>
<p>And please, if nothing else, experiment.  Experiment knowing that you can learn
from an experiment failing as well as from an experiment succeeding.  There is
no right answer that works for everyone.  Just a patchwork worth of process that
is tuned to how you work.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lots of external stuff, but I am glad I took the time to describe how I work
through a change problem.  Finding that set of processes that work for me took
years, and even then, I tweak and change them as I grow and learn.  Regardless,
it is good to share and perhaps helps others.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am making progress on the last batch of scenario tests that were added, but it
is slow process.  Hoping to get further on that this week.
Stay tuned!</p>
