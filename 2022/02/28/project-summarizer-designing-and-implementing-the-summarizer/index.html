<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/02/21/project-summarizer-why-was-it-needed/">last article</a>, I
talked about the reasoning behind one of the tools I use:
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pyscan">Project Summarizer</a>.
In this article, I talk more about the reasoning and designs behind the tool, and
the recent improvements I have made to it.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you can use a screwdriver when you need a hammer, and sometimes you can
use a hammer when you need a screwdriver.  But more often than not, you really
need to have the right tool for the job you are doing.  If nothing else, you want
to make sure that you know you did things right and did not take any short cuts.</p>
<p>Once I had identified a set of requirements and could not find
a tool that was meeting those requirements, I knew I needed to do something. The
result of meeting those requirements was the Project Summarizer tool.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>

<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between

<h2 id="some-quick-design-work">Some Quick Design Work<a class="headerlink" href="#some-quick-design-work" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/02/21/project-summarizer-why-was-it-needed/">last article</a>,
I had a set of requirements that were not being fulfilled by other tools.  Namely,
those requirements were:</p>
<ul>
<li>to summarize the analyses of other tools</li>
<li>to give me immediate feedback on how my changes affect code metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>While these were not very extensive requirements, they were the guiding principles
that drove the initial development of the Project Summarizer tool.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the way I envisioned this tool as something that was fast and took
information from other tools to summarize.  The first use case was for my own
Python projects, so meeting those requirements for my Python projects was of course my
first goal.  To carry out that goal,
the new tool needed to fit into the scripts that I use to run tests on my projects.
Added as part of the test scripts, I knew that I had two output files at my disposal:
the XML coverage file from <code>coverage.py</code> and the XML tests file from <code>pytest</code>.
Using those files, I knew I could provide a summary of any changes in tests or test
status, and I could provide a summary of high-level coverage numbers.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-enough-to-help-me">Is It Enough To Help Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-it-enough-to-help-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Would that buy me enough benefit to make it worth the cost?  Yes!  At the time,
once I finished making changes, the four questions that I always found myself
asking were:</p>
<ul>
<li>did I make the right fix?</li>
<li>how did it affect the tests that I already had in place?</li>
<li>did the fix require the addition of new tests to cover the new code in the fix?</li>
<li>did the fix create code that is no longer needed, and is safe to be deleted?</li>
</ul>
<p>The first question is one that I seriously believe can only be answered by thorough
testing, experience with the code, and time.  The best answer that I can usually
hope for to that question is “yes, for now”.  As time goes on, that answer will
either lean towards or away from that “yes”.  It is often hard to tell in isolation.</p>
<p>However, I felt that the remaining three questions could easily be answered by
data.  How did I know that?  Because I had manual tasks that I performed to answer
those questions.  For the first question, I looked at the PyTest output to see
if anything failed.  If something failed, I look at the PyTest HTML files to see
what tests failed and why.  For the second and third questions, I went right to
the HTML coverage output, and followed a similar procedure.  And I figured that
if I could do it manually, I could automate it.</p>
<p>If I could automate that process, it would be good enough for me.</p>
<h2 id="getting-off-the-ground">Getting Off The Ground<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-off-the-ground" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The initial version of Project Summarizer (originally called PyScan) was quickly
put together, meeting these
requirements head on.  Using the XML files as input, I quickly dug the
required statistics out of those files.  For the test output files, I only needed
to know if a test was added, removed, or changed status.  For the coverage output
files, I only needed to know if the various coverage metrics changed.</p>
<p>At that point, I realized that I needed to introduce a third requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>to create a “checkpoint” that could be used to compare current values against.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I looked at the raw summary numbers from the file, the one thing that they were
missing was context.  To be blunt, I found it difficult to remember if I had 128
tests or 129 tests before I made the change to add a new test.  I did not care
most of the time. What I cared about was whether the number of tests increased
by one to match the one test that I added.  This pattern carried over into the
coverage requirements.  I only cared about the change in coverage, not the current
coverage number.</p>
<p>But to generate a difference value, you need to have a value to compare the current
value against.  That was missing at that point, so I created it.  Thus, the <code>publish</code>
directory was created and the <code>--publish</code> flag added to the Project Summarizer.
By publishing the existing summary to the <code>publish</code> directory, any current change
was able to be measured against that checkpoint.  I did have to establish a habit
of running my <code>clean</code> test script with the <code>-p</code> option to publish the results when
I closed out a fix, but that habit was not too bad to form.</p>
<p>And things were coming together nicely.  I was able to update either source code
or test code, and a summary of those changes was being reported
to the command line.  After a couple of weeks, I invested some time into learning
about the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/columnar">Columnar</a> package and used it to better organize the output.
And it was not fancy, but it worked and worked well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Test Results Summary
--------------------


  CLASS NAME                               TOTAL TESTS  FAILED TESTS  SKIPPED TESTS

  test.nested_three.test_markdown_nested_     133             1 (+1)         8 (-1)
  three_block_ordered
  test.test_markdown_extra                     87 (+7)        2 (+2)         1
  ---                                        ----             -            ---
  TOTALS                                     4528 (+7)        3 (+3)       171 (-1)
</pre></div>
<p>Taken from some work that I did during the past week, this clearly showed me what
was going on with my changes.
As this was a focused execution of tests, I had the coverage summary disabled.  But
the information provided by the test results was particularly useful.  I had added seven
tests and removed the <code>@pytest.mark.skip</code> from one test, which is reflected in
the output.  And as I was working on resolving issues, I had five of the tests
taken care of, with three failed tests remaining.  That was exactly the information
that I needed to know I was going in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="time-passes-and-the-tool-matures">Time Passes… And The Tool Matures<a class="headerlink" href="#time-passes-and-the-tool-matures" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I continued to use the Project Summarizer tool for about a year before I started
to think about making changes to it.  And even then, it took me having a couple of
issues calling it from another script to get me to realize that I needed to make
a couple of changes.  And those changes were not substantial changes, but simple usability
changes.</p>
<p>I had one issue when calling Project Summarizer from a script, where it had a
challenging time figuring out a consistent answer to the question “what is the width of
the screen”.  As <a href="https://pypi.org/project/columnar">Columnar</a> bases its organization of the columns on the
number of character columns on the display, it raised an interesting question of
what to do if there was no actual terminal.  There are defaults built into Columnar,
but they did not seem to be consistent.  And if I wanted predictable behavior, I
needed consistency.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <code>--columns</code> argument was added.  This would override any calculated
values and force the Columnar package to a specific size.  At the same time, I
figured that there were cases where that output was not important.  As such, I
also added a <code>--quiet</code> argument to suppress the columnized output.</p>
<p>The second issue that I had was that the reporting and publishing directories were
both hardcoded.  That was easily fixed with the <code>--report-dir</code> and <code>--publish-dir</code>
arguments.  While I do not predict changing these directories in my own setup,
it did sound like a solid addition to the tool.</p>
<h2 id="why-now">Why Now?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-now" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I guess the question that I left unanswered was: why did I feel that I needed to
work on this now?</p>
<p>The simple answer was that I found other things to measure.  One of the things that I
currently measure is the number of PyLint warnings in the current project.  But
that information is hard to see, and I would like to have better visibility into
how those values have changed on an ongoing basis.  But when I thought about how
to design that tool to include summary information, I decided instead that it would
be better for the Project Summarizer to do that reporting for me.</p>
<p>But that meant I needed to update the Project Summarizer to manage more information.
As I started to do that design, it just seemed like the right thing to get those
changes I had in mind out of my head and into the project. The good news is
that even after I got those changes out of the way, it still felt like a good idea
to upgrade the Project Summarizer tool to be extendible.</p>
<p>In fact, I seriously think it is a great idea!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This week, I plan to do more research and design into making the Project Summarizer
tool more extensible.  Hopefully, that means I will have something interesting
to report next week.
Stay tuned!</p>
