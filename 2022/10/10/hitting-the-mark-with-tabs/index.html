<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="{filename}/articles/Personal/keeing-focus.md">last article</a>, I talked
about how I try my best to maintain focus on my various endeavors. In this
article, I talk about how I am making strides to get any remaining whitespace
issues dealt with.  Namely, tab characters.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When going through the initial requirements for the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project
a couple of weeks ago in <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/09/26/thinking-about-direction/">that week’s article</a>,
I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was closer to a final release than I thought
I was.  Specifically speaking, it was comforting to find I only have a little bit left
to do with respect to whitespace handling.  More specifically, there is only
a little bit of work left to do with the handling of tab characters as whitespace.</p>
<h2 id="tabs-are-evil-no-really">Tabs Are Evil… No, Really<a class="headerlink" href="#tabs-are-evil-no-really" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just like many older software development professionals, I have a bit of a hate
relationship with the tab character.  It is nothing personal against the actual
character itself.  It is just that for the majority of my professional development life
I have had other developer imply that tab characters are evil.</p>
<p>I think that feeling may come from “ye olde
<a href="https://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/08/OnReligiousWarsinSoftware.aspx">religious wars</a>” of years
past.  It was not uncommon in the 1990s and 2000s to hear conversations between
developers extolling the virtues of “tabs as 2 spaces” versus “tabs as 4 spaces”
versus “tabs as 8 spaces”.  They were always conversations that I put into the
category of conversations known as <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">bike shedding</a>.
They were mostly trivial conversations with little hard evidence.</p>
<p>My point of view on concepts like software style have remained static over
the years.  I do not care much for any reasonable style or coding guidelines if
it is clearly documented.  Bonus points to any team that is using code analysis
to ensure that every commit follows those guidelines.  I just remember too many
“deep” conversations on teams about tabs and how they converted into spaces to
really care one way or the other.  And like most developers, I just stopped using
tab characters to avoid the noise of those conversations.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-takes-a-different-tact">Markdown Takes A Different Tact<a class="headerlink" href="#markdown-takes-a-different-tact" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The people authoring the <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#tabs">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>
specification had probably also had some of the same experiences I had, so they created
an entire section to detail how they want tabs to be handled.  And instead of taking
one of the approaches detailed in the last section, they changed it up a bit.  From
the specification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tabs in lines are not expanded to spaces. However, in contexts where whitespace helps
to define block structure, tabs behave as if they were replaced by spaces with a tab
stop of 4 characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, parts of that are somewhat vague, but they spelled out the important part: that
one tab character is a tab stop of four characters.</p>
<p>What is a tab stop?  On old typewriters and word processors, there was the choice to
specify multiple locations on a given line that were destinations for the tab key.
When the tab key was pressed, the position on the line would move to the next place
that the tab key was told to stop.  Hence the name, tab stop.
When this functionality was moved into word processors, this same behavior was
replicated to allow people to seamlessly translate their typing skills between
typewriters and the word processors.  As some of the more popular applications
in the first personal computers involved creating documents, this was probably
a good direction to take.</p>
<p>Hopefully not sounding too ancient, I remember taking typing classes on electronic
typewriters and loved that I was able to translate my typing skills to the new computers in
the computer lab.  While we used those computers to create programs during computer labs, we also
found out that it was easier to type our essays and other assignments those same computers.
When I used a typewriter to type those same essays, I always needed a healthy supply of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Paper">Liquid Paper</a> on hand
to help correct all the mistakes I made.  Being able to use a computer to craft the
documents like I am doing with this article was a new concept… something that we
now take for granted.</p>
<p>These days, tab stops are still in use.  When authoring this article, I tested out
the tab support with both Markdown files and Python files and learned that Visual
Studio Code (VSCode) uses tabs stops of four for both types of files.  To be honest, I hoped
that VSCode would support for Markdown files, but was not sure.  I was happily
surprised at the tab stop support for Python files.  From my own viewpoint, that
one observation gave the authors of the GitHub Flavored Markdown specification
extra credibility in their choice.  It was a still a pain to implement it, but
that was on me, not them.</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-short-cut">Taking A Short Cut<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-a-short-cut" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now, at almost three years after I started writing PyMarkdown, I have a better
appreciation for the tab character and how it can be used creatively.  But when
I started writing the original implementation for PyMarkdown, having tab characters
being interpreted as a tab stop of four was a nuisance.  From my developer point
of view, anyone in their right mind would always use spaces instead of tabs.  It
was the quickest way to avoid the “tabs as…” holy wars after all.</p>
<p>As such, when I added support for tabs to PyMarkdown I used a shortcut.  As I was
convinced that any “sane” person would shy away from tab characters, I wanted to
take the quickest path to implementing tab characters.  From my point of view, why
add support for something most people are not going to use?  As such, I added the
support at the highest level of the tokenizer to replace tabs characters with
the proper space characters.  All done and correct, right?</p>
<p>Fast forward to the current day with more experience and a deeper understanding
of Markdown.  Some readers may question why I started talking about my days with
electric typewriters and word processors.  But from my new point of view, I believe
that thinking back to those days helped me understand why the specification has
support for tab characters as tab stops.</p>
<p>That point of view is a simple one: replacing tabs with a constant number of space
characters is how a developer thinks, but it is not how people usually think when
writing documents.  When people open word processors, they expect that word processor
to support tab stops.  However, most people will not think about it in that way.
For the most part, if they use tabs in their documents, they will use those tabs to
line up columns of information.  If they need something fancy, they may try and
insert tables and play with column widths and titles.  But for something quite simple,
tab characters come in very handy.</p>
<p>It was with that new viewpoint that I looked at the issues left to take care of
and decided that I needed to add proper tab support in to PyMarkdown.  The next
question was how to add it back in.</p>
<h2 id="balancing-alternatives">Balancing Alternatives<a class="headerlink" href="#balancing-alternatives" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I had two choices on how to add tab characters support back in. The first was to
replace code that was currently working with code that also supported tab
characters.  The second choice was to do post-processing in select sections to convert
space characters back into the tab characters that spawned them.</p>
<p>After back and forth on the pros and cons, I decided on the second approach.
While it is adding complexity to the project, I believe it was a valid
calculated risk that I needed to take.  If I take tab support out of the equation,
I am happy and confident with PyMarkdown as it stands.  I do find the odd issue
here and there, but that is normal with most projects.  From my point of view, I wanted
to add tab support back in as a solid feature, not a bug fix.  As such, adding extra
support in to properly translate space characters back to tab characters seemed like
the right approach.</p>
<p>That approach is paying off well so far, except for Indented Code blocks,
I believe all the Leaf Block elements are taken care of.  As of the writing of this
article, I am currently working to flush out the paragraph support for handling
generic text that has tab characters.  Since elements such as autolinks
are invalid if they have any tab characters, they can present themselves as
paragraph text.  It just seemed like a clever idea to make sure those bases were
covered.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Based on what I was working on last night, I hope to have paragraphs wrapped up and
committed within the next couple of days.  That leaves Inline Elements, Indented Code
blocks, and Container Blocks that I need to work on.  I am not too worried about
Inline Elements, but I am concerned about the other two.  To properly capture the
tab character in Markdown that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">first</span> <span class="n">line</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">second</span> <span class="n">line</span>
<span class="err">\</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">third</span> <span class="n">line</span>
</pre></div>
<p>is easy.  The tab character becomes four space characters to help it reach
the next tab stop. But this Markdown is a bit more nuanced:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">first</span> <span class="n">line</span>
<span class="err">\</span><span class="n">tsecond</span> <span class="n">line</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The same character expansion occurs, but which of the two elements should “control”
the tab character.  The token for the list block or the text token for the list content?</p>
<p>I am not sure at this point… but I am hoping to have an answer by next week.  Stay tuned!</p>
