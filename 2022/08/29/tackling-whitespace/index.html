<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/08/22/figuring-out-the-best-course-of-action/">last article</a>, I talked about
my continuing work on the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project,
and how I evaluated the adding of new features to the project. In this article,
I talk about going back and ensuring that one of the foundations of any word-based parser
is solid: whitespace handling.</p>
<h2 id="it-all-starts-with-whitespace">It All Starts With Whitespace<a class="headerlink" href="#it-all-starts-with-whitespace" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my experience writing over ten different parsing engines over the years, the
one aspect that does not get enough attention is the definition of whitespace
and how it applies to the parser.  For code parsers, whitespace is often seen as
unimportant and is seen as space-filler between the “real” focus of the language:
the keywords.  Even Python, with its indent-based semantics, is not far from that
appraisal.</p>
<p>But when translating from one language or format to another, whitespace can play
a key role in deciding how something is interpreted.  That is how things are
structured with Markdown, specifically <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavoured Markdown</a>
or GFM.  As one of the main goals of Markdown is to allow people to author documents
in a near-authentic format, adding any unnecessary verbiage or formatting was frowned
up.  Specifically, the <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-markdown-">GFM states</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable
as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is,
as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To preserve that readability, whitespace is used creatively in Markdown.  A good
example of this is the Indented Code Block.  This is a section of the document,
often computer related code, which needs to be passed unaltered to the reader. As the
name suggests, each line in this code block is preceded by an indent of at least
four spaces.  While it does not have the language naming capability of its sibling
the Fenced Code Block, the Indented Code Block supplies the same code block
experience without negatively affecting the readability.</p>
<p>But support different experiences in different situations, the use of whitespace
must be broken down a bit.</p>
<h2 id="whitespace-and-markdown">Whitespace and Markdown<a class="headerlink" href="#whitespace-and-markdown" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To keep things simple, Markdown provides for three types of whitespace.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#space">space character</a> is written as <code>U+0020</code>
or <code>\u0020</code> depending on the format.  In many of the cases where
a space is allowed, a <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#tabs">tab character</a> (<code>\t</code> or <code>\u0009</code>)
is allowed and is treated as up to four spaces as if the tab character was a tab stop.  The
fun part there is that most developers think that the tab character is unilaterally
expanded to four spaces, instead of interpreting it as a tab stop.  Therefore,
when reading the specification, any reference to <code>spaces</code> means a specified number
of space characters or tab characters.</p>
<p>Expanding from that simple definition of spaces is the definition for
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#whitespace-character">whitespace characters</a>.  This
definition includes both the space character and the tab character but adds the
newline character (<code>\n</code> or <code>\u000a</code>), line tabulation character (<code>\u000b</code>),
form feed character (<code>\f</code> or <code>\u000c</code>), and carriage return character (<code>\r</code> or <code>\u000d</code>).
Basically, what this does is to allow for a whitespace construct that includes any
character that is typically used to separate words, lines or paragraphs.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#unicode-whitespace-character">Unicode whitespace character</a>.
This is a more expansive version of the whitespace character, adding all the
characters from the Unicode <code>Zs</code> and subtracting the line tabulation character.
While I am clear on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58421027/what-is-the-use-for-control-characters-in-string-printable#">the prior use</a>
of the line tabulation character, I am less clear on why it has fallen out of
use.  My best guess is that with modern systems, the concept of scrolling down
to a given line is outdated, and hence its inclusion into whitespace is less
important than it once was.  But as it is in the specification, I follow it!</p>
<p>Getting these definitions clear in my head was important to me.  If I am going
to increase my confidence that I have the right type of whitespace selected for
a given element, I need to know what those whitespace types are.</p>
<p>And before anyone asks… no, this is not glorious work.  But this is necessary work.
The items in the whitespace section have been on the issues list for almost as long
as the project has been around.  I need to make sure that I have a clear
implementation of the whitespace handling for the project.  Not for any sense of ego
or anything like that, but to make sure it is right for the users.  I want that
confidence that I implemented the whitespace handling correctly.</p>
<h2 id="issue-456-cleaning-up-whitespace"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/456">Issue 456</a> - Cleaning Up Whitespace<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-456-cleaning-up-whitespace" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I was originally coding the parser behind PyMarkdown, I did not understand
these distinct types of whitespace as I do now.  To bring my understanding more
in line with the specification, I have made minor changes to the way the parser
handles whitespace over the last two years.  But in the back of my mind, I was always
concerned that I missed something.  Hence, there was a section in the original
<code>issues.md</code> file that dealt with whitespace and correctness.  Having taken a quick
look at that section again, I thought it was an opportune time to finally resolve any confidence
issues I had with whitespace.</p>
<p>Opening a new issue, I decided to take a muti-task approach to solving any
outstanding issues.  The first part of that was making sure that I had a clear
understanding of what the three distinct types of whitespace were.  Once that
was taken care of, I carefully went through the specification and created a list
in the issue’s ticket, detailing each element and the types of whitespaces contained
within that element.</p>
<p>The results of that list were interesting: there were four types of whitespace
involved.  The most prevalent whitespace type was the <em>spaces</em> type, which seems
to be the default whitespace type, appearing in ten elements.  From there, the
<em>whitespaces</em> type was the next most popular, appearing in six of the elements.
In a tie for last are the whitespace type used in link labels and the whitespace
type used in emphasis.  The emphasis type is the <em>Unicode whitespace</em> type and
is very expansive on what it includes.</p>
<p>The new type is the <em>Unicode case fold</em> used to compare link labels with a matching
Link Reference Definition element.  The best description that I found is
<a href="https://github.com/arodland/Unicode-CaseFold#what-is-case-folding">in this project</a>
and basically walks through the answer to the question: how to do a case insensitive
match with a full Unicode codeset.  While I could try and describe the folding
process more, I believe the article does a much better job of explaining it and
would suggest any readers check that article out if they want more information.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-scenario-tests">Creating The Scenario Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-the-scenario-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the list compiled, I started the process of adding a new set of scenario test
cases to the project.  As I am a big proponent of Test-Driven Development, it was
imperative that I implemented the tests first so I could understand the scope
of what I needed to deal with. As I have detailed in earlier articles, this is not a fun
process, but a necessary one.  Over three days, I added 166 new scenario tests to
the project, all dealing with testing how whitespace is handled for each of
the elements in the list.  As emphasis is the only element to use the Unicode
whitespace type, and I want to test Unicode punctuation support at the same time,
I left emphasis scenario tests out of that list for now.</p>
<p>It was a brutal process, but I was used to it (somewhat) by now.  Working through the list,
I copied a series of tests from the series before it, changed the function name and
the function description, and changed the internals.  Then the process was a
simple one: change the Markdown sample to demonstrate the scenario, verify with
Babelmark that <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> produces the same HTML results
that I calculated, and then run the tests themselves.  With the test output, I then
verified that the HTML output matched CommonMark and that the generated PyMarkdown
tokens looked correct.  Lather rinse repeat.  Many times.</p>
<h2 id="more-work-yet-to-come">More Work Yet To Come<a class="headerlink" href="#more-work-yet-to-come" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am done generating the 166 new scenario tests.  Along the way, I noticed that
33 of those scenario tests were not functioning properly, so I marked them as
skipped.  My plan for this week is to start attacking that list and see how many
of the scenario tests I can get working by the end of the weekend.  Since it
is the Labor Day holiday weekend, I am going to take it somewhat easy, but I
still want to make significant progress on this task.</p>
<p>On one hand, the items have lasted almost two years without any progress, so
what is another week.  But that is not good enough for me!  Now that I have an
idea of the work involved,  I want to solve any issues and finally put whitespace issues to
rest.  Stay tuned for the progress!</p>
