            <p>Upfront, I want to add this disclaimer for any relatives that may decide
to read this article.  I am going to be honest about how I felt and
what we talked about on my trip.  You may not agree with what I say or what we
decided, but our parents asked us to make sure they were taken care of, and their
wishes followed.  All three of us talked about what they had asked for, and
while we all agreed, I am the eldest son. If you want to blame anyone for things
not going your way, blame me.  My shoulders are wide enough and strong enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wow, the last two weeks have been one heck of a roller coaster ride
for me personally.  From joyful highs to mournful lows, I have seen it all
in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>The joyous highs were all about my brother and his longtime girlfriend
getting married in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia on 30 July.  Not one to shy away
from doing things with a bit of pomp and circumstance, the wedding party
was a sight to see.  The women were all dressed in lovely dresses and beautiful
shows, and the men were dressed in khakis, Hawaiian shirts, and sandals.  The
thing is, knowing my brother and his now wife (and my new sister!), that was not
out of character.  It just worked.</p>
<p>As we left the hotel, a wonderful gentleman named Colin (hope I got the name
right, it was a busy day!) bagpiped us from the hotel to the dock where we
boarded the sailing ship to take us out into the bay.  Even through all of
fuss of getting everyone on board, Colin played strongly and consistently
until it was time to cast off.  After waiting almost ten years for this
wedding, my brother&rsquo;s wife did not want to do anything second rate.  A
wonderful sailing vessel with a wonderful crew, and a wedding on the water.</p>
<p>Even more interesting was that the rain that happened that day did not seem
to dampen anyone&rsquo;s spirits in the least.  Sure, it meant donning rain ponchos
for some of us and umbrellas for others, but everything was still a go with
everyone having big smiles on their faces.  And with the backdrop of the
Lunenburg lighthouse in the background, the minister presided over the ceremony
like the champ that we all knew her to be.</p>
<p>And as luck would have it, with the speaking of the words &ldquo;You may now kiss
the bride&rdquo;, the rain stopped.  Within fifteen minutes, the sun was out and
within another half an hour, most of us were at least partially dry.  But it
didn&rsquo;t matter in the least.  It was not about the weather.  It was not about
the sailboat.  It was not about the bagpiper.  It was about my brother and
his wife getting married.  And nothing was going to damper the happiness of
that event!</p>
<p>But the next morning, reality started to kick back in.  My wife and I had
planned a nice drive along the coast from Lunenburg to Peggy&rsquo;s Cove, one
of the famous places in Canada.  The sun was shining, and the coast
was beautiful, but my mind was already starting to turn inward.  I tried
to suppress that urge inward during the drive, but it was a daunting task.
Finally, after suppressing the urge all day, I started to turn inward as
we rested at our hotel in Halifax for the evening.</p>
<p>It had been over four years since the three of us had gotten together, so there
was much catching up to do.  Well, I say there was much catching up
to do, but really it was just listening to the same stories and information
we had heard on the phone calls we try and have each month.  Those same stories
just seemed to have a different shine to them when told in person.  Everything
just was &ldquo;that much&rdquo; better.  Of course, being a true Canadian, it did not
hurt that we talked over dinner or over that day&rsquo;s Tim Horton run.</p>
<p>But the one thing I knew we needed to talk about before the end of the trip
were my parents.  We all knew the pieces of those stories, but we
all felt that it was important to make sure that we were all in unison going
forward.</p>
<p>The easy one was my father. My father passed away recently in Halifax, with
specific instructions on how he wanted to be buried and where he wanted to be
buried.  The problem there was that it was back in the Toronto area, and my
brother and his wife would not be going back for a while.  They just finished
their wedding, my brother is finishing school, and his wife is working.  It
will happen when it happens, and we all agreed to adhere to my dad&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>For any readers that have read my articles, they will know that my dad and
I were not close.  One of the reasons is that I believe my dad was on the
Autism spectrum, just like me and my son.  Connection with other people was always
difficult for him, and I remember a handful of conversations where I believe
he was trying to understand why that happened, but to no avail.  I sincerely
believe he tried, but he just did not have the tools or support to make it
happen.  Most of the other serious conversations that we had were about the war.</p>
<p>Being born in 1933, my dad was in his teens during World War II.  I had heard
stories from him about how things were, but only a couple of times.  He really
did not want to remember it at all.  He did join the Belgian Army once he was
of age, but he developed PTSD from that stint in the army.  By the time I was
old enough to talk with him about it and understand parts of what he said, he either shied
away from talking about the war and the army or talked about it like tar was
dripping from his mouth.  I did not see my father cry that many times in my
life, but in each conversation that included the war, he always cried.</p>
<p>Between all those circumstances, he just got to a place where he
could not manage being a full-time father, and my parents got divorced.  It
took me a long time to process what happened and what the factors involved were.
I believe that having PTSD and probably having undiagnosed Autism played big
factors.  I think he would have stood a chance at being a good father if he had
been born forty years later, but it just was not so.  Without the understanding of PTSD
and Autism that we even had in the 90s, he did not stand a chance.</p>
<p>I can say a few things about my dad for certain.  He hated any war and tried to
avoid conflict.  He felt sorry that he could not be a better father and tried
to overcome that deficiency in his own way.  He often wanted to communicate; he
just did not have the tools to communicate effectively. Because of his hate
of war and conflict, he just wanted to be buried alongside other family members,
just as a normal person, leaving any of the military experience that he felt
ruined his life behind.</p>
<p>With that agreed on, we turned to talk about my mother.  With her having late-stage
dementia, my sister moved my mother to a long-term care facility a couple of
months ago.  It was heartbreaking to have my sister describe her recent visit
with my mom, but I believe she thought it was the right thing to do.  Even so,
I almost started crying myself as my sister fought back the tears and described
her visit.</p>
<p>Dementia is a vile disease that takes parts of the person away bit by bit
until only a shell is left.  It started with her forgetting certain things around
her home, such as whether she locked the door or whether she already had her
meals.  After she moved into an assisted care facility, she stabilized for a
while before more things disappeared from her mind.  Before long, she was walking
into other people&rsquo;s rooms, thinking that it was her room she was walking into.
By the time she was moved to a long-term care facility, even that was mostly
gone.</p>
<p>It was weird talking about my mom in the past tense, but it felt like the right
thing to do.  There was a person that looked like my mom in the pictures that
I saw. But according to my sister, she is not sure that there is anyone she
recognizes in that body anymore.  The only communication that my mom seems to
do is with people that are not there anymore.  We are not sure if she is replaying
memories in her mind or talking to people that have passed before her.  We
do not even know if she is aware of where she is.  But to us, as terrible as
it sounds, she is not there anymore.</p>
<p>Getting agreement between the three of us on what to do when it is my mother&rsquo;s
time, which was the easy part.  She was a devout Roman Catholic and wanted to
be buried beside her second husband by her home parish priest.  With the state
of air flights, the way they are, the only questions were around what will we do if we
cannot get a flight to Toronto when she passes away.  And we agreed that I will
try my best, and we will cross that bridge if and when it is needed.</p>
<p>Grieving about what is happening is the hard part though.  How do you imagine
a world without the one person who gave up her marriage without a second though
because of the effects of my father&rsquo;s PTSD?  Someone who was there to listen,
whether she agreed with you or not.  Someone who gave back to her community
in any way she could up until the dementia made it dangerous.</p>
<p>The only good news is that the meeting with my siblings I think
helped the grieving and healing processes along.  But it is going to take
a long time for me to process this.  Step by step, day by day.  Remembering
the good moments of both parents, whether they were only a couple or whether
they were as bountiful as the flowers that were always in my mother&rsquo;s
gardens.</p>
