<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="http://localhost:8000/2022/09/26/thinking-about-direction/">last article</a>, I talked
about the various things that I am thinking about for getting the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project closer
to a solid initial release.  In this article, I talk about how I try
my best to maintain focus on my various endeavors.</p>
<h2 id="focus-is-not-always-forthcoming">Focus Is Not Always Forthcoming<a class="headerlink" href="#focus-is-not-always-forthcoming" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In today’s digital world, it is easy to get distracted.  It is for that exact
reason that I infuriate my family by leaving my cell phone in another room. As
a matter of fact, I will often leave it at home when going out, just so I can
focus on other things than the phone.</p>
<p>For most readers that own a smart phone, that need or sensation that I am talking
about is something you feel on a frequent basis.  That urge to check to see if
someone has left a text for you.  That urge to check social media and see if someone
has posted something that you might be interested in.  That urge to play a game
of solitaire on your phone and see if you can get a new level.  We have all been
there.  It is overwhelming sometimes.</p>
<p>As my Autism continually floods my mind with things to analyze, maintaining focus
on anything is something that I need to work on constantly.  And the level of focus
that I may want in any given situation is not always forthcoming.</p>
<h2 id="get-rid-of-focus-busters-if-possible">Get Rid Of Focus-Busters If Possible<a class="headerlink" href="#get-rid-of-focus-busters-if-possible" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>No, it is not the failed pilot attempt to mimic the success of the ever popular
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters">Mythbusters</a> series.  But, to be totally
honest, it would not be a bad fifteen minute Public Service Announcement if done
properly.  These are all the small things that get in the way of me getting a lot
of work done on whatever project I am working on.</p>
<p>For me, the first thing on the list is music or lack of music.  If I am being
creative or relax, I find that music helps.  As I have Sensory Overload Disorder
due to my Autism, any little bit of noise can prove to break my concentration.
Having some predictable music in the background helps me not notice that background
noise and instead spend a small amount of focus ont he music.  I sometimes call it
my musical focus tax.  On the other hand, if I am doing something more physical, I
find that music can get in the way of focusing.  So when I am working outside or
in the garage, I tend not to have any music on at all.  Never thought about why that
is… I’ll try and figure that out sometime.</p>
<p>After music and the previous mentioned smart phone, the next thing I get rid
of is anything environmental.  If it is too hot in the room, I turn on a fan.
If it is too cold in the room, I put on an extra layer.  If my feet are too
cold (not an analogy, my feet are almost always physically cold), then I sometimes
put on socks, but mostly will put on a pair of warm slippers.  If I am feeling
thirsty that day, I make sure to have a glass of water that I can sip at as I
work.  None of these are major items on their own, but I have found that each of
them can contribute to me loosing my focus at the most inopportune times.  And
with few exceptions, they all have easy mitigations.</p>
<p>The final group of focus-busters should be a pretty easy group of stimulus that
everyone is aware of: notifications.  On my home computer, I do not have any visual
or auditory notifications in place so I can concentrate without any disturbances.
If I am seriously focusing, my cell phone is in another room.  If not, it is usually
within three meters of my desk.  Basically, for any notifications that I am concerned
about missing, the person either has my phone number or lives in the same house and
can come into my home office.  As such, there is seldom any need for any notifications.
I check for email and text messages as time allows, and that is all that is usually
needed.</p>
<p>On my work computer, it is a bit different.  While I do need to maintain focus at
work, there is more of a focus on responding to colleagues and clients in a timely
manner.  To achieve this balance, I turn the volume on my work laptop down and have
music playing on an external speaker during work hours.  I am not sure if this would
work for others, but it allows me to selectively focus on the laptop noises if I
choose to focus on them.  Perhaps it is a learned skill, but I find it helpful.
It is also helpful that I am not afraid to turn the volume off if I need to maintain
focus for thirty minutes or more, such as reviewing a document.  But I try my
best to turn the volume back on when done, to maintain that balance with response
time.  It is not easy, but I make it work.</p>
<p>That gets rid of some of the distractions that I face.  But I find that is only
half the battel.</p>
<h2 id="and-those-were-the-easy-things">…And Those Were The Easy Things<a class="headerlink" href="#and-those-were-the-easy-things" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cell phone tucked away where I cannot see it or hear it.  Check.  Music to groove
to and cover background noise.  Check.  Environmentals mitigated.  Check.
Notifications mitigated.  Check.  Now for the hard part.</p>
<p>I am not sure how others perceive focus and concentration, but for me it is a
frame of mind that I need to get in.  Basically, I need to feel a connection to
what I am doing and ensure that I can think about that thing without pausing.
Take writing this article for an example.  During each of the phases of writing
this article, I have to focus differently to acheive the goal I am trying to
meet.  Depending on the goal, if I lose my focus I may need to go back to the
start of the line I was working on, if not the entire paragraph.  That is
one of the reasons I hate losing focus… I have to repeat myself and hope
for the same results again.</p>
<p>And getting in a focus frame of mind is a fickle thing.  One thing that I know
helps me is to make sure I draw a solid imaginary line in my head  between the
different things that I am doing.  If I am switching from professional work to
anything on my home computer, I almost always take a walk or watch some anime.
It helps me to clear any residual thinking from work out of my system. Sometimes
watching short films on my home computer does the trick, but more often than not
I have to physically change environments for at least twenty minutes.  I need
that separation.</p>
<p>If I am doing any kind of work and I need to change focus, be it my own open source
work or professional work, I find that some of the same rules apply, but with
some softening.  While I will not watch anything online while at work, I will
frequently move around, go to the bathroom, or clean up the dishes when switching
focus at work.  I can try and switch focus without such a clean break, but I
often find that trying to force it just amplifies the cost of switching focus.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the task is, I have to find that “groove” that allows me to
think about what I am doing in a way that is conductive to what I am doing.</p>
<p>For example, me focusing on debugging is annoying to people around me because
I often talk through things as I debug.  Now, I have this thing where I talk
in a whisper when I am doing that, but that seems to confuse people.  Basically,
it looks like I am having a full conversations with myself but they cannot hear
anything.  So I try not to do that in office settings.</p>
<p>As another example, for creating new code and new features, I need to scribble.
As old fashioned as it sounds, I need to have a couple of pieces of blank paper, jotting notes
to myself as I go.  Some of those notes will be about improvements to the code
and some about improvements to the tests, including different types of test data
to try against my current implementation.  I just write my thoughts out or provide
a drawing and worry about what it means later.  For some reason, the act of switching
tabs or windows on a computer causes me to lose my focus while the scribbling
does not.  So I stick with what works.</p>
<p>And for me, these are the things that work for me to help me keep my focus. That is
the important thing for me to remember.  Different people focus in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="snapping-out-of-it">Snapping Out Of It<a class="headerlink" href="#snapping-out-of-it" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As part of my Autism, I have a tendancy to <a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/hyperfocus-flow">hyperfocus</a>.
Most people have heard stories of “that person” who kept on doing something they
were focusing on while everything around them was going on, only to express
confusion later as to what happened.  That is me.  When I was working in an office,
I wore headphones to play music (see above) and drown out the background noise.
There were times where I would hyperfocus on my work to the point that someone was
waving their hands behind my monitor and I would not recognize them.  While it
was sometimes comical to others, I was often embarassed by it.</p>
<p>Looking back to those times, I think that the hyperfocus was triggered by the
amount of effort that it took me to focus in an office environment.  While I do
occasionally hyperfocus at home, it occurs less frequently by orders of magnitude.
My best guess is that I had to try so hard to get into the right frame of mind
and cancel out all the erratic visual stimuli, and as a result, just mentally
negated it in my head.  Seeing as I haven’t done any serious focusing since I
started working from home, I think its a good guess.</p>
<p>Another time when it happens is when I feel that I am under a lot of stress. While
I actively try and mitigate stress using various techniques, I do still get stressed
like other people.  The last time I got very stressed was around the time that
I talked about in <a href="http://localhost:8000/2022/05/30/crashing-on-a-side-project/">this article</a>.  I
felt that I had to find the solution and I was letting myself down for not finding
it.  That reduced my ability to focus on the problem which in turn causes me to not
be able to concentrate on possible solutions.  Enter the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>From experience, it is important for everyone to have ways to get that focus
and concentration out of their system and reset.  As counter intuitive as it
may sound, I find that for me to concentrate on things more clearly, I need to
work on how to release those same things from my thoughts.  Basically, I need to
be able to walk away.
My crash in May taught me that this is something important that I need to work
on.  I got into a viscious circle that took me over two months to properly
recover from.  I was not sure how to let it go, and it just dug into my psyche
so deeply that it hurt.  And it was mentally draining.</p>
<p>So while it is important to be able to figure out how to focus, I have great
confidence that it is also important that I take time to figure out how to
remove the effects from focusing on myself.  And I hope readers can learn
that without having a crash situation, but unfortunately failure is a great
teacher.  But my fingers are still crossed for any readers!</p>
