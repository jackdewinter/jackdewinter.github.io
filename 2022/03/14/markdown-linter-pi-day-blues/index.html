<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/02/21/project-summarizer-why-was-it-needed/">last article</a>, I
talked about the reasoning and designs behind the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pyscan">Project Summarizer</a>
too that I use.  In this article, I drift back to the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project for a while and talk about what is happening there.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Things over here at my house have been a bit rocky professionally and personally.
It is nothing serious and nothing that I cannot deal with given the proper time
and mindset to deal with it.  Just multiple things converging at the same time
making life difficult for a while.  As such, while I did want to make more progress with the
Project Summarizer tool, the extra bandwidth in my personal life just was not there.
Rather than try and force work on the tool and then not being happy with myself
or my effort, I decided to bounce back to the PyMarkdown project and concentrate
on familiar ground for a while.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/152c2561f569dd4444c2f8f8f4625bf67ae7e774">13 Feb 2022</a>

<h2 id="state-of-the-project">State Of The Project<a class="headerlink" href="#state-of-the-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wow… a whole month has passed and there have been a lot of minor changes here
and there to the PyMarkdown project.  While there are no new stellar features to
report, I feel that the nested container testing is coming along.  Granted,
it is coming along slowly, but I can see that the progress in stability is worth
the effort.</p>
<p>I guess that is why, during this weird time where multiple negative events seem
to be hitting at the same, I find solace in this work.  Do not get me wrong.  The
work itself is needed for the project. And it is creative, but
it is also a very constrained problem space.  Somewhat like a logical fuzzy blanket
that I can use for a while.</p>
<p>For those that do not understand, let me try and explain it this way.  Sometimes,
when walking through our house, things can seem out of sort to me.  When this happens,
I look around for a handful of things
that I can clean up in five or ten minutes that will have a decent impact on how
I think the room looks.  I might not clean everything up and I might just reorganize
things to look cleaner, but that action helps me put my mind at ease. And for the record,
the messiest room in our house is not my office, it is the kitchen followed closely
by our dining room table.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, I find that cleaning up code and making a project
better helps me to clean up some of the “mess” in my mind. It is not the
same thing, nor does it have the same level of impact.  But still, it helps.  Whether
it is improving documentation, adding more specific scenarios tests, or cleaning up code that
I was not happy with, it is all about leaving the project a bit better than when
I found it. That is what helps me put my mind at ease.</p>
<h2 id="python-dataclasses-typing-and-mypy">Python, DataClasses, Typing, and Mypy<a class="headerlink" href="#python-dataclasses-typing-and-mypy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have been learning and exploring in Python over the last five years.  In that
learning, I often find that the learning takes its own time and happens at the
weirdest of times. And I just hit one of those learning “bumps”.</p>
<p>During the odd downtime in my professional job or in my personal projects, I browse
various parts of the web.  In some cases, it is to search for a better way to do
something, and in other cases it is just about exploring.  Either way, I often learn
about interesting things that spark my creativity.</p>
<p>It was while I was working on research for another project that I came across a
concept known as data classes.  Covered more completely at the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/dataclasses.html">Python Docs Pages</a>,
the base concept behind dataclasses is a simple one.  Instead of setting up a class
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>

    <span class="nd">@property</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">x</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">x</span>

    <span class="nd">@x_index.setter</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">x</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>

    <span class="nd">@property</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">y</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">y</span>

    <span class="nd">@y_index.setter</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">y</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
</pre></div>
<p>you can set up a class like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">dataclasses</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">dataclass</span>

<span class="nd">@dataclass</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Point</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span>
    <span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Even more interesting are the cases where you do not want those values to be
changed.  In that case, using <code>@dataclass(frozen=True)</code> will not generated any
setters for the class.</p>
<p>To be clear, truly immutable objects in Python is not possible, but this language
feature comes close to it. Knowing the design of the PyMarkdown project
as I do, I thought dataclasses would be useful and started looking at them more
in-depth.</p>
<h2 id="python-typing">Python Typing<a class="headerlink" href="#python-typing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>My research flowed from dataclasses into one of the concepts
that they introduced me to: Python Typing.  In the dataclass example above, the variable
is specified with a type that follows it.  That type is what Python calls a “Type
Hint” and simply supplies a hint as to what the developer thought that type should
be.  The Python interpreters do not do anything with that themselves, but tools
such as <code>Mypy</code> use that information to check to see if each type usage lines up.</p>
<p>After reading the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">Mypy documentation</a>, or at least
a good handful of examples, I was hooked. There really is not a TL;DR on this, but
here is my first take on it.</p>
<p>Type Hints are exactly as they sound, hints.  In a normal Python interpreter,
if the type hints do anything, they are essentially null operations.  But with other
tools, such as editors and Mypy, they provide extra type information that is used
is various forms. For editors, this information is often used to show type information
when the developer is changing a Python file. For Mypy, it evaluates assignments
and parameters to ensure that the specified types suggested by the developer are
being adhered to.</p>
<p>That is it. But in that lies its simplicity and usefulness.  There is no switch
in the Python interpreter that says “Thou shalt use type hints!”  Instead, as things
progress, I can add type hints to different classes as I have time. After I have
added those type hints, Mypy will start checking assignments to and within those
classes. And my VSCode editor will have extra type information to provide better
information when I am editing the project files.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-this-lead">Where Does This Lead?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-does-this-lead" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, I am going to try and add in Type Hints
where I can and see how that goes. I have already transformed a handful of data-only
classes into <code>dataclasses</code>, and that went off without any fuss. I am plodding
along with resolving the parsing issues, but I am “plodding” at a good pace.</p>
<p>One thing that I have noticed is that it has been over a month since the last
incremental release.  My current plan is that once I hit a solid wall with any
remaining issues, I am going to make sure things are clean and get that next
incremental release out.  I know I still have more scenario tests to add and
test, but the fixes from the last month are decent and need to be published so
that users can receive fixes for those issues.</p>
<p>I wish that I had the extra bandwidth to be creative and work on the Project
Summarizer tool, but I acknowledge that my head is just not currently in the
right space for that.  But that doesn’t mean I cannot still be productive!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am hoping that things start settling down in my life in the next week or two.
But a lot of that is currently out of my control. I am dealing with it at a good
pace, just a decent number of things to figure out and deal with.  So, to be honest, I am
not sure what I am going to work on this week.
Stay tuned!</p>
