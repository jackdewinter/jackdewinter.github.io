<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/03/14/markdown-linter-pi-day-blues/">last article</a>, I
talked about drifting back to the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project for a while and talk about what is happening there.  One of the things
that I latched on to was Python Type Hints, which is what I dug into the past
week.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Things have been very time-consuming in my life recently.  Perhaps in the next couple
of months, I will write an article about it.  Who knows?
The effect of those things happening is that I did not publish an article
last week.  I was about 60% done with a first draft of the article, and I just
ran out of steam.  Nothing bad really happened, it was just that life was very
draining for a couple of weeks, and it caught up to me.</p>
<p>When it came down to it, I just didn’t feel that I could do my best to complete
the article.  Quite simply, I did not feel that I could author an article
that I would be proud of.  So, I decided to wait to complete it.  And as
the week went on, things in my life resolved and lightened up considerably.</p>
<p>So here goes.  Sorry for the wait.</p>
<h2 id="python-is">Python Is…<a class="headerlink" href="#python-is" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the wonderful things that I like about the Python programming language is
that it is wonderfully untyped.  As someone who is creative, I often find that my
creativity in other languages is slowed down by trying to figure out what types
to use in what scenarios.  Not that types are a bad thing, I just find that using
strict type systems often hinder my creative process.</p>
<p>As I understand it, one of the cornerstones of the Python language is that it is
the behavior that dictates the language, not the other way around.  To illustrate
that understanding, consider two separate objects that are both initialized to
have a <code>self.my_var</code> member variable.  The underlying assumption is that if I have
a function whose behavior is to act on that variable, it does not matter which
object or which instance of a class holds that member variable.  The passing of
that object into the function is behavior enough.</p>
<p>And that kind of thinking that “we are adults in the room” permeates through a
lot of Python.  There are no interfaces as in Java and C#.  Because of the loose
typing, there are no needs for generics.  Things just work.</p>
<p>But using a language that does not have strict typing also has its share of
problems.  For one, since everything looks the same, any kind of function hinting
in source editors struggles to figure out the proper set of functions to display.
Say a variable was initialized to a <code>None</code>, then an <code>int</code>, and then a <code>str</code>. What
function hints should the editor display and when? It is situations like that
where things get complicated.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-python-type-hints">Introducing Python Type Hints<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-python-type-hints" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I have used Python for over four years now, it was only in the last couple
of months that I came across Python Type Hints.  To be clear, the name is exactly
as it sounds.  These are hints, not mandates, for how to interpret types within
the Python languages space.  To use a simple example, consider this Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">"something"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It is not really that interesting, therefore it is easy to read.  Therefore, compare
it to the following code, from PyMarkdown’s <code>main.py</code> module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">"""</span>

<p>What makes this function readable is that most of the heavy lifting has been delegated
off to the ten functions that <code>main</code> function itself calls.  But look at
the function call to the <code>__determine_files_to_scan</code>.  What kind of arguments does
that function require?  What kind of return values does that function produce?
Without good answers to those questions, using that function creates some hurdles
that we must jump over.  But what if we could reduce those hurdles a bit?</p>
<p>That is where type hints come in.  Having already been modified during this past
week, that function definition currently looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__determine_files_to_scan</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">eligible_paths</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">recurse_directories</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">bool</span>
    <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Tuple</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">]:</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="what-are-type-hints-used-for">What Are Type Hints Used For?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-type-hints-used-for" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To be redundantly clear, Python type hints are exactly that, hints.  Any Python
code with type hints is
interpreted by Python interpreters without using those type hints.  However,
packages like the <code>Mypy</code> package and the Python extension for VSCode can be used
to take advantage of those type hints.</p>
<p>In the case of VSCode, the use of those type hints allows it to provide
better feedback to someone editing Python code.  Having started to apply type hints
to my Python code, I can already see the benefits as I am editing that same code.
Instead of me having to do search-and-replace to find the definition of the
function to determine how to interact with it, most of that information is displayed
in a handy popup that appears when I add the open parenthesis for the function call.
At the top are any type hints that I provided, and at the bottom is any documentation
that I added with a docstring.  That is useful.</p>
<p>The other strong use that I have found for type hints are in the usage of the
<a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">Mypy</a> type checking tool.  From my understanding of this
process, Mypy builds a model of what it is being scanned, including any type hints.
It then compares usage of variables and function to what it believes to be the correct
typing, emitting warnings when the usage does not mirror what it believes to be the
correct types.</p>
<p>In its normal mode, this is useful in making sure that there is consistent usage
of variables and types throughout a module.  But with that, there is a price to
pay.</p>
<h2 id="paying-the-price">Paying The Price<a class="headerlink" href="#paying-the-price" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>My first stab at adding type hints started fifteen days ago
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/b469155be7757209fea149e8ca534e3ab63feea2">with this commit</a>.
It was not anything grand, but it was a start.  Just some simple changes to see
how things work.  From there, I started to pick off individual modules and
start to convert them where possible.</p>
<p>Basically, find something to work on, fix it, validate it, and move on.
Then repeat that pattern many, many times.  I found that I was shifting between
responding to the result of this command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run mypy --strict pymarkdown stubs
</pre></div>
<p>to figure out what the next change to tackle was, and this command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run mypy pymarkdown stubs
</pre></div>
<p>to resolve any fallout from those changes.  Then, when I thought I had a good chunk
of work changed, I would enter this command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ptest -m
</pre></div>
<p>to execute the complete set of tests to verify the changes worked.  And it just
kept on going.  The good news is that I started with over 4400 issues found with
<strong>strict mode</strong> enabled, and now that is down to 1147 issues.  Getting close to
being done, but not there yet.</p>
<p>And it is a very costly process to add it to an already existing project.</p>
<h3 id="cost-1-optional-values">Cost 1: Optional Values<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-1-optional-values" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the things that I did not think about while writing the Python for the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project was my use of
the <code>None</code> value.  Instead of producing good default values to denote that
some action was not performed, I just assigned the <code>None</code> value to the
corresponding variable.</p>
<p>What was wrong with that?  Nothing at the time.  But when I added type hints, it
forced me to use the <code>Optional</code> type around the type of the variable.  Instead
of using a type like <code>int</code>, I found that I had to use the type <code>Optional[int]</code>.
And that brought a whole lot of extra effort to adding type hints.
Because the keyword literally means that the value can be a valid integer or the
value <code>None</code>, in places where it was introduced, I had two options.</p>
<p>The first option was to use the type as it was, returning <code>Optional[int]</code> from
that function if needed.  But then, I was just delaying the evaluation of the second
option.  If I needed to return an <code>int</code> or pass an <code>int</code> while calling another
function, the second option was to do something to remove the <code>Optional</code> around the type. In
a handful of cases, a well-placed <code>if variable:</code> statement was used to do just that.
But in most cases, the variable was wrapped in an <code>Optional</code> type in
the rare occurrence that it would be set to <code>None</code>.  In those cases, I simply preceded
any reference to that variable with <code>assert variable is not None</code>.</p>
<p>That was painful but it was what was needed.  The painful part was that I needed
to then run the <code>ptest -m</code> command to make sure that all paths through the code
were not triggering that assertion.  And while I would like to see I got them
all on the first try, that was not the case.  In those cases, it was reset and
try again.</p>
<h3 id="cost-2-getting-types-wrong-in-tokens">Cost 2: Getting Types Wrong in Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-2-getting-types-wrong-in-tokens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far, it has only happened two times, but having a single variable that contains
multiple types is not desirable.  That practice is very undesirable when those
variables are member variables of Markdown tokens.  Because each basic scenario test
validates the list of Markdown tokens produced by the parser, in addition to verifying
the HTML produced by applying a transformation to those tokens, any change in what
is being tokenized can require many scenario tests to change.</p>
<p>It is through sheer luck that these have been kept to a minimum.  In one case,
it resulted in the correction of three scenario tests.  In the other case, over
three hundred scenario tests needed to be fixed.  The issue?  In some of the failure
cases, the variable was set to the string value of <code>""</code> instead of the boolean
value of <code>False</code>.  While both values equal to <code>False</code> when used in a
Python conditional, enforcing a <code>bool</code> type meant changing many empty string values
in that particular token to a <code>False</code> boolean value.</p>
<h3 id="cost-3-resolving-cycles">Cost 3: Resolving Cycles<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-3-resolving-cycles" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another cost is one of making sure that I get each module agreeing on which other
modules they need to import, and in which order to import them.  This is particularly important as
Python has no ability to resolve module cycles using forward references. Instead,
as soon as the modules try and resolve their import statements during interpretation,
a cycle is detected, and a cycle exception is raised.  From my research, there are two
ways to get around this.</p>
<p>The first way is to make sure that the
functions and classes are cleanly organized so that cycles do not occur.  A good
example of this are classes like <code>InlineRequest</code> and <code>InlineResponse</code>.  These two
classes used to be contained in the <code>InlineProcessor</code> module before this work
started.  However, there were a small number of cases where the <code>InlineProcessor</code>
module imported another module that also needed the <code>InlineRequest</code> or
<code>InlineResponse</code> classes.  As such, that other module would try and import those
classes from the <code>InlineProcessor</code> module, causing a cycle to occur.</p>
<p>The solution?  By lifting those two classes out of the <code>InlineProcessor</code> module
and into their own modules, other modules could them import those two classes
without importing the <code>InlineProcessor</code> module.  This was the easiest way to break
the cycle.</p>
<p>But in some cases, this was not possible.  While things worked properly when
typing was not in the picture, there were a small number of cases where the
<code>import</code> statement was needed with no way to reduce the cycle.
That is where the second method of avoiding cycles comes in.
For these
cases, the following pattern was used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">TYPE_CHECKING</span>

<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">TYPE_CHECKING</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="c1"># pragma: no cover</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pymarkdown.tokenized_markdown</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ParseBlockPassProperties</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It took me a while to find this, but it works cleanly.  Having a good understanding
of how type hints could get complicated, the <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> global variable was
added as a work-around.  Set to <code>False</code> by default and to <code>True</code> by Mypy, the
above fragment of code only imports if type checking is enabled.</p>
<p>How does this help?  As the code works fine without the type hints, the above
import is only being done to ensure that the type hints are correct.  As type
hints are not necessary for the normal interpretation of the Python code, the
interpreter can safely disregard any type hints.  Therefore, as the type hints
are only used for type checkers like Mypy, the <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> global variable
is used to detect if that is the current evaluation mode of the module, only
importing if that is the case.</p>
<p>It took me a while to get behind it.  But from my experience, it is both simple
and brilliant at the same time.  It is a good example of cleanly dividing
responsibilities.</p>

<p>As I mentioned early, Mypy has gone from detecting issues in the 4500-issue range
to the 1100-issue range, with that number decreasing with each change.  It is a
prolonged process, but I feel that it is a good one.  I can already
see benefits in VSCode when I am editing the project.  On top of that, it has
helped me to clarify some of the implementation details that I have done over the
course of the last two years.  Those are good things.</p>
<p>But do not get me wrong, it is a slog.  This effort does not erase any technical debt
and does not make the project function any better.  What it is doing for me is
to make the code more maintainable and more readable. While it is not erasing
any technical debt, it is improving the quality of the project.  That it not as
quantifiable to others, but to me it is an important quantification.</p>
<p>And while others might not understand that difference, it is good enough for me.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With over 75% of the project converted, the best answer that I can give right now
is that I hope to have the conversion finished by the end of the week.  Not sure
if it is possible, but I am going to try for it!
Stay tuned!</p>
