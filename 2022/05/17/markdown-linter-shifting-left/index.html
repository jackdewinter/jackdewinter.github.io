<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/04/25/pylint-utilities-a-long-time-coming/">last article</a>, I
talked about working on some of my projects to get their code coverage up to
100% and why I felt that the effort was important.  In this article, I focus
more on the work I have been doing in the background on the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, I have been doing work on the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project in the background.  I may not be visible, but it is going on.  It was not
until this week that I have something concrete to show for that work.  And since
not having something to talk about on my flagship project caused me concern,
I thought I would devote an article to the reason for that delay: debugging.</p>
<h2 id="shift-left">Shift Left<a class="headerlink" href="#shift-left" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>During my recent round of interviews, one of the concepts that I talked about was
shifting the debugging process left as much as possible using automated
testing.  As an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test), a large part of my
job is to provide solid automated tests that can be executed within a continuous
integration pipeline.  Shortened to “shift left”, this form of thinking strives
to get any kind of test failure as close to the development of the code being tested
as possible.  And yes, that does include trying to find things at the architecture
and design phases if possible.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-you-mean-left">What Do You Mean “Left”?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-you-mean-left" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let me start with the “left” part of that phrase.  In most development processes,
whether it is explicit or not, there is a workflow that happens from ideation to
release.  In more formal environments, these steps are usually something like
ideation/requirements, architecture, design, vetting the design prior to implementation,
implementation, unit and functional testing, peer review, integration and end-to-end
testing, and
release.  In less formal environments, these steps are still there, just compressed
into fewer steps with some steps “missing” or “implied.  While each of those individual
steps is deserving of an article of its own,
the important thing that I want to communicate is that flow from “an idea” to
“a released thing”.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, once the bug fix or feature has been released, there may
be added iterations of that workflow.  These iterations can be done to tighten
up misunderstood requirements but are most often performed to address bugs in the
design or implementation.  It might be tempting to think of that new workflow
as part of the original workflow, I believe there are clear reasons that the workflow
is separate.  As that is probably enough content for a separate article, please
take my word on that belief for now.</p>
<p>Given those foundations, it should be easy to see that the further left in the workflow
that a team gets, the more cost accumulates from the previous steps.  Before the
implementation step, most likely everything has been done with some form of project
lifecycle management system, be it something like the popular <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>,
using a whiteboard, or writing things down on paper. The implementation and first
testing step introduce code provided by a developer, increasing the cost by a
sizable amount.  Peer review adds to that by bringing the cost of having multiple
developers spend time looking at the changed code, as well as any requested changes
that they ask for to be implemented.  The second level of testing, integration and
end-to-end testing, adds another cost multiplier as those types of tests are
more fragile automated tests because of their distance from the implemented code.
Finally, the release step
adds another multiplier of cost as any issues that are reported once a change is
released must go through yet another team of people to report any issues with
those changes, prioritize those issues, and create new workflows to address any
prioritized issues.</p>
<p>As someone who has done a lot over thirty years of development in his career, please believe me.
The further an issue makes it into that workflow, the more costly it is.
When I say “costly”, those multipliers are usually between three times multipliers and
10 times multipliers.  And that is if the team is lucky.</p>
<h3 id="so-where-does-the-left-come-in">So Where Does the Left Come In?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-where-does-the-left-come-in" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given that information about the traditional development workflow, there is a simple
directionality to it.  Writing that information on a whiteboard, I would simply
create a simple line with dots on the line representing the various points in the
workflow.  At each point, I would annotate the point with one of the names
associated with the workflow.  Given that perspective, the workflow has a simplified
flow from the left of the line to the right of the line.</p>
<p>Therefore, when I am talking about “Shift Left”, I am talking about trying to detect
issues in a project as early on in the project as possible.  While this may seem like
a “duh” moment to some people, having issues creep to the left is a quite common
occurrence on development teams.
As a developer, I want my code to get out there and be used.  As a developer, I want
to do something interesting, not the same old thing repeatedly.  And as a
developer, I have felt pressure from above to get one thing done and to more on to
the next thing on my plate.</p>
<p>However, about 12 years ago when I was a developer, I realized I was more concerned
about the quality of what my team was producing than the velocity with which my
team was producing.
I was more concerned with taking extra time to ensure that the requirements were
correct before moving forward with implementing them.  And automated testing? Back
then I faced a lot of pushbacks for adding too many tests to a project, as those
tests were believed to be unwieldy and hard to support.</p>
<p>But my justifications for wanting to do those tests were solid.  Based on my experience
and my reading of peer articles, others in the industry had started to see things
in a similar light.  More importantly, they were starting to talk about it in more
clear terms than I could manage at the time.  For those of us who “saw the light”,
it came down to a simple bit of calculus. Either a team can impose a small overheard to
take care of those issues before they escape OR that team can pay a cost for
those issues later.  A team can call those issues “tech debt” or anything
else they want to, but they are misses for the team just the same.</p>
<p>And those misses are costly and can be demoralizing.  The cost part of any miss is easy
one to calculate.  Instead of incurring a small cost to find and solve the issue
before it escapes the team’s view, one or more distinct workflows must be spun up to
address that issue.  In terms of human cost, one workflow is that people were needed
to report the issue and people were needed to confirm that it is an issue.  Another
workflow was then needed to triage the issue to figure out if it has a high enough
priority to fix.  And those two workflows are needed before the team needs to create
a new workflow to fix the issue.  In financial costs, each person in those workflows
has a salary.  Paying a team to fix issues means that the team cannot be working on
improvements to the project. There is the cost for them contributing to one or more
workflows, and there is the cost of not having those people working on new work.
Simple math.</p>
<p>As to the demoralizing aspect, that aspect is one that I have seen quite often.
I have been in meetings where teams have been told of the issues related to their
project. Most teams try not to assign blame, but it does happen. There are often
questions raised as to
how the team missed finding that issue.  If I had a dollar for each time in my
career that I have heard “How did we miss that?” in a meeting, I would be able to
buy my wife a fancy seafood dinner with an expensive bottle of wine.  And
when the team gets such a backlog of issues that they must dedicate an entire
block of work to dealing with those issues?  Let me just say that I can usually
sense a drop in the energy level in the room without much effort when the manager
says, “we are going to need a bug fixing sprint.”</p>
<h3 id="shift-left-is-about-paying-the-right-cost-at-the-earliest-time">Shift Left Is About Paying The Right Cost At The Earliest Time<a class="headerlink" href="#shift-left-is-about-paying-the-right-cost-at-the-earliest-time" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>“Shifting Left” is about dealing with these issues as efficiently as possible.
To get a project to be better,
the proper investments need to be made as far to the left in the workflow as possible.
Problems with architecture and design?  Make sure the requirements are solid and
the architects and designers understand those requirements, with a solid understanding
of the tools and choices at their disposal.  Problems with poor implementations?
Make sure the developers understand the requirements and designs and supply guidelines
for them to follow to prove that they have met those goals.  Problems with changes
to implementations creating new issues?  Make sure that there are solid integration
tests that are independent from the developer-created tests.</p>
<p>Will these catch everything?  Not even a chance.  However, when I have seen practices
like this implemented, it has always made a sizable impact in the quality of the
project.  And truthfully, any decent reduction in the cost of a change is usually
worth it.  It is just about paying the right cost as the earliest
time possible.  Noticing a requirement seems off before coding starts?  It can
be a five-minute conversation, or it may evolve into a meeting with a small group.
But avoiding the act of properly reading that requirement until one or more integration
tests expose that issue?  That cost will definitely exceed the cost of that small
group meeting.</p>
<p>And the other part of that is simple. As a developer, I always wanted to write decent
quality code, because the person maintaining that code was most likely going to be
me.</p>
<h2 id="shift-left-on-pymarkdown">Shift Left on PyMarkdown<a class="headerlink" href="#shift-left-on-pymarkdown" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>How does this all apply to the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project?</p>
<p>While I try as hard as possible to catch everything up front during the implementation
phase, things do slip through.  As of this Sunday morning, I have 4530 scenario tests
that are executed for each change.  Of those tests, 36 are skipped with 12 of those
skips being for placeholder implementations of extensions.  That leaves 24 scenario
tests for issues that slipped through the cracks. According to my math, which means
that over 99.4% of the scenario tests are passing.  Not a bad number, but I still
would like it to be better.</p>
<p>And to be clear, that count of 4530 scenario tests are not just the test scenarios
provided by the <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">Github Flavored Markdown</a> specification,
but every scenario test I have been able to create.  That includes the 673 scenarios
presented in the GFM specification, but also stresses the complications that arise
from container elements.  If I had to guess, I would say that at least half of the
current scenario tests are tests specifically for the handling of container elements.</p>
<p>But that percentage of passing tests is a deliberate focus of mine to “Shift Left”
on this and other projects.  While it can often lead me to be frustrated with a new
feature or change not working properly in all cases, I sincerely believe that this
is the right approach.  As I find a single issue at any point in the process, I
look and see if it is an isolated issue or part of a bigger issue.  If it is part
of a bigger issue, I try and identify related scenarios in the “area” of that issue
and add more scenario tests.</p>
<p>If possible, I do this when I am adding something new, but I am not always
that lucky.  But from where I sit, I am still trying to push it to the left.  I am
not waiting around for a user to complain that it is not working properly, I am
actively investing my time to prove to myself that the project is working properly.
Sure, some of the scenario tests are probably never going to get hit by users,
but those tests are still important. Each one of those tests is a path that may
not have been covered before.</p>
<p>What it comes down to me is the answer to a simple question: What amount of confidence
do I have that the project is working properly?  My simple answer is: yes! I have
thrown everything I can think of against it and can prove that.  And if I miss
something, I am graceful in that I know I cannot think of everything and use that
new information to build better tests.</p>
<p>For me, shifting left just helps me get that confidence as efficiently as possible.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having recently been able to squash an issue that impacted three scenario tests,
I compiled a brief list of other tests to revisit.  I am not sure if I will be able
to find their solutions, but at least I feel momentum in that direction.
Stay tuned!</p>
