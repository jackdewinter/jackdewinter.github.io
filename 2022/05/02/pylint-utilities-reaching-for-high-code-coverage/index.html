<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/04/25/pylint-utilities-a-long-time-coming/">last article</a>, I
talked about the first
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pyscan">Project Summarizer</a> plugin that I created
as part of my
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pylint_utils">PyLint Utilities</a> project.
In this article, I talk about the changes that I incorporated into both projects
to get their code coverage percentages up to 100%.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From past articles, longtime readers will understand that I view quality and
the metrics that help me understand that quality on a sliding scale.  One of the most
basic and useful metrics that use is tracking the code coverage of tests that are in place
for the components being tested.  To be clear, I agree with  people that argue that
code coverage is not the be all and end all of quality.  But I also argue
very confidently that it is not a metric to be easily dismissed.</p>
<p>Code coverage does not measure if a project is working properly. It
measures whether each line of code has been executed at least once.  A project can
have 100% code coverage and still fail to meet its criteria for a project that
meets its intended goal.
From my point of view, which is where scenario tests come in.  And whether those
tests are a complete picture of how the team envisions the project being used is
a trickier thing to measure.  That is why many teams, for each piece of work,
construct individual
<a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2014/09/acceptance-criteria/">acceptance criteria</a>
or maintain collections of rules called
<a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/02/definition-of-done/">Definition of Done</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I have not seen any automated way to review either of these.  As a
professional, I can create scenario tests that exercise these two concepts with
respect to what I am testing.  But those scenario tests need human review
to determine if they are doing what they are supposed to.  But by combining the
exactness of code coverage with the observable scenario tests, I believe it is
possible to get a product that is well-tested and that does what it is supposed
to do.</p>
<p>And most of the time, getting there is half the fun.</p>
<h2 id="slight-adjustments-to-project-summarizer">Slight Adjustments to Project Summarizer<a class="headerlink" href="#slight-adjustments-to-project-summarizer" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To start off, before I made these adjustments to deal with this new plugin, I had
confidence that the scenario tests were testing the right things and I knew that
the code coverage was at one hundred percent.  From my viewpoint, it was a well tested
project that was doing what I needed it to do.  And it meant that I wanted to
keep those confidence levels where they were going forward.</p>
<p>Cue the hard work!</p>
<h3 id="nice-side-effect-finding-a-setup-issue">Nice Side Effect - Finding A Setup Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#nice-side-effect-finding-a-setup-issue" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of testing the new plugin, I ran into an issue right away: I
could not execute the Project Summarizer from its package.  I tried executing it
locally, and there were no problems, but when I looked in the local package that
I was using, some of the files were missing.</p>
<p>After a bit of work, I found myself looking at these lines in the <code>setup.py</code> module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PACKAGE_MODULES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">"project_summarizer"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the uploaded package, everything was fine.  I knew something changed.
Examining the contents of the new package more closely, I noticed that only the
files that I refactored into their own directories were missing.  Given that observation,
I tried this change:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PACKAGE_MODULES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">"project_summarizer"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"project_summarizer.plugin_manager"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"project_summarizer.plugins"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And was greeted with success!  I was able to execute the Project Summarizer project
without any issues.  Talk about a bit of a testing hole that I need to address in
the future!</p>
<h3 id="debugging-the-dictionary-issue">Debugging The Dictionary Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging-the-dictionary-issue" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One command line argument that I have in other projects that I had not added to this
project was the <code>--stack-trace</code> argument.  It is a simple argument that instructs
the error handling to also print out a stack trace.  It is not useful in everyday
use, but when I need a stack trace of a failure, it is invaluable.</p>
<p>And this was the case with the new plugin and the <code>save_summary_file</code> function.
When the exception occurred, it was reporting that it was having issues dealing
with generating a report, but nothing more specific.  That was by intentional and by design.
When things fail, I do not want any users getting cryptic error
messages that confuse them.  As such, I keep the error messages as generic and
easy to read as possible.</p>
<p>But in this case, I needed to debug the issue and I just wanted something simple.
Remembering that I have the <code>--stack-trace</code> argument in other projects, I quickly
added it to the Project Summarizer project, where it immediately pointed out that
the issue was with the <code>save_summary_file</code> and that it was passed a dictionary
object to save.  As the object to save was already a dictionary, calling <code>to_dict</code>
on it was causing the error.  A quick fix and some added tests, and that issue was
cleared up.</p>
<p>While I hope to not need that argument again, I now know it is there in case
I need it for future debugging sessions.</p>
<h3 id="easy-is-not-always-easy">Easy Is Not Always Easy<a class="headerlink" href="#easy-is-not-always-easy" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>When I designed the plugin architecture, I wanted something that was simple and
easy to use.  I did not anticipate any large manipulation of
data within the plugins: they were supposed to summarize data that was already
present.</p>
<p>But then when I started testing the PyLint_Utils plugin, I
hit a snag.  The current design allowed each plugin to format the data
and print it out in its own format.  Since I want to keep things simple, I coded
all three implemented plugins to use the <code>columnar</code> package to format the data.
I did not have any issues with this approach for the first two plugins, so I
did not anticipate any issues using it again for the PyLint_Utils plugin. Until it
failed.  It was able to load
the plugin module but failed to load the <code>columnar</code> package.</p>
<p>I researched this for two nights before determining that it was likely
not possible to do.  What I mean by that is that it may be possible, but after two
nights and five hours of research and experimentation, I was not able to find it.
I needed a Plan B.  Seeing as I figured out that every plugin was going to be
using some manner of package for outputting the summary… I cheated.  While
there are other columnizers out there, I already have <code>columnar</code> installed for
the base package.  As such, I just changed the interface to the <code>generate_report</code>
function.  If a tuple is returned, it is used as the three primary parameters
for <code>columnar</code>: justification, title, and rows.  Problem solved.  Not pretty,
but problem solved.</p>
<h2 id="switching-to-pylint_utilities">Switching To PyLint_Utilities<a class="headerlink" href="#switching-to-pylint_utilities" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With those issues dealt with, the Project Summarizer project was back at
100% code coverage and all relevant scenario tests were in place.  So, it was time to
get back to the thing that initiated those changed, the PyLint_Utils project.
It turns out that more then half of the changes I needed to execute the PyLint_Utils
project were in the Project Summarizer, so I thought I was home free.</p>
<p>And then I got down to improving the code coverage.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-only-so-much-you-can-cover-normally">There Is Only So Much You Can Cover Normally<a class="headerlink" href="#there-is-only-so-much-you-can-cover-normally" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>First off, I want to stress that I am a bit of a fanatic about scenario test coverage
and code coverage.  If it is a normal application, I have a general rule that it
should have at least 75% code coverage, scenario tests for all “good” paths, and
scenario tests for any “bad” paths that a team feels will be hit a fair amount.
And yes, “a fair amount” is a judgement call.</p>
<p>The good paths are an easy goal for me to
justify. If everything goes properly, you know that users will hit those paths.  The bad
paths are a bit more nuanced.  From my viewpoint, I start with this question: what
are the things that I would mess up or have messed up when using the application?
Things like missing parameters and bad or wrong file names are easy targets.  I mess
those up all the time.  That is usually a good starting point for error-related or
“bad” pieces of the project to include.</p>
<p>From there, the cost of covering the paths start going uphill very quickly. And for
each path, it comes down to the question of whether the cost of covering that “bad”
path is enough of a benefit to warrant the cost involved.  And the cost can be
varied.</p>
<h3 id="hiding-things-in-plain-sight">Hiding Things In Plain Sight<a class="headerlink" href="#hiding-things-in-plain-sight" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing that I do to determine cost is to try and see if I can do something
simple to write
a new scenario test without too many changes.  Can I change the file from a JSON file to a
non-JSON file or a directory to set off error handling?  Can I use two parameters
together and make sure they do not conflict?  Is there an existing path that I
can leverage?</p>
<p>But sometimes, I must be sneaky.  Take this “hidden” parameter that I
have in the PyLint_Utils project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_argument</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="s2">"--x-display"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">dest</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"x_test_display"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"store_true"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">""</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">help</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">argparse</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SUPPRESS</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That parameter is not visible using <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code>, but if you use it in a normal
command line, the application will not complain.  How is that? The <code>argparse.SUPPRESS</code>
suppresses that argument from being shown.</p>
<p>So why take this approach?  In this case, that flag sets off this logic:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__display_progress</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">isatty</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x_test_display</span>
<span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__verbose_mode</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I have no control over what <code>sys.stdout.isatty()</code> returns, at least not yet.  As
such, this is a simple and easy to read way to alter the results of that function.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-mocks">What About Mocks?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-mocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is where the <code>not yet</code> from the previous paragraph kick in.</p>
<p>From my experience, mocks are most useful when you want to test something that has
many moving pieces to it.  To use the equation, I postulated a couple of sections
ago, is the cost of making the change worth the benefit of that change?</p>
<p>For me, the answer to that question is heavily based on experience.  The benefit
of that equation is the easy part to define.  Either using some other method or
completing the block will properly test part of the code.  The cost is much
more difficult to define.</p>
<p>A good example of this difficulty is the <code>PatchBuiltinOpen</code> class that I use for mocking file
open calls, located <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pyscan/blob/master/test/patch_builtin_open.py">here</a>.
I have used this for testing various smaller Python projects for almost as long as I have
been working in Python, and I find this object really good at getting into tight
places for code coverage.  This mock class patches the built-in <code>open</code> call for
files and provides the <code>register_text_content</code> function and the <code>register_exception</code>
function to control what gets controlled.  If the filename passed to those functions
matches the argument for the <code>open</code> function, one of those two behaviors is returned.
If not, the mock object needs to carefully un-patch itself, call the original function,
and then patch itself again.</p>
<p>Even without looking at the source code for the <code>PatchBuiltinOpen</code> class, it is obvious
that the function has a significant amount of code to accomplish those tasks.  Why?
Because it takes a sizeable number of sentences to describe what it does.  And then
there is the invocation of this behavior.  To mock an <code>open</code> function call that is
buried within the code called from the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">execute_results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">scanner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">invoke_main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arguments</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">supplied_arguments</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>this is the code required:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">pbo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PatchBuiltinOpen</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">pbo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">register_exception</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">test_file_to_scan_path</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"wt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">exception_message</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">mock_exception_message</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">pbo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="n">execute_results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">scanner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">invoke_main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arguments</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">supplied_arguments</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">finally</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">pbo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stop</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is not simple.  This is a sledgehammer.  Granted, a nice sledgehammer that
has been well used, well-polished, and carefully taken care of, but it is a
sledgehammer.  And in my experience, code sledgehammers increase cost.</p>
<h3 id="but-sometimes-there-are-no-other-options">But Sometimes There Are No Other Options<a class="headerlink" href="#but-sometimes-there-are-no-other-options" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having taken care of the majority of the code coverage for the project, I was left with
a small amount of code to cover.  This code was code that was enacted after the
<code>subprocess.Popen</code> function is called when PyLint_Utils calls PyLint itself.
In terms of benefit, it was the only handful of lines that were not covered.
In terms of cost, the only option was to mock out the function call.</p>
<p>The <code>PatchSubprocessPopen</code> was the result.  Copying the bulk of the functionality
from the <code>PatchBuiltinOpen</code> class, I was able to save a lot of time.  Another
thing that kept the cost down was that as of right now, I only needed the mock
object to be specifically for this one scenario test.  As such, I was able to
tailor it very specifically for the tests in which it was used.</p>
<p>But even then, it was a headache to get right.  I had to make sure I read each
variable from the <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> parameters properly, translating them
into values I could use.  As <code>POpen</code> can be called multiple times, I had to
make sure I had a passthrough in there.  And debugging it was not the best
experience I had.</p>
<p>But in the end, to get from over 99.5% to 100% was worth it to me.  I was
able to get more experience with mock objects in Python, and I was able to
close the gap in code coverage.</p>
<p>For me, it was worth it.  But it was costly.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What Is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With that bulk of work wrapped up, I am hoping to get some time back on
the PyMarkdown project in the next week.  Here is hoping for that!
Stay tuned!</p>
