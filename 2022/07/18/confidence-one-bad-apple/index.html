<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/07/12/are-scenario-tests-worth-it/">last article</a>, I talked
about my progress in adding scenario tests for the nested container scenarios
for the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.
In this article, I talk about the struggles to regain my confidence that I have been having
since my crash at the <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/05/30/crashing-on-a-side-project/">end of May</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am going to let any readers of this article in on a little secret.  I do not
like reality television shows where people expect to get famous and do stupid things.
However, I do like reality shows where the show documents one or more interesting
aspects of work that gets done or where people are help each other.  Especially
if one of those two things are done in a weird or novel way, I am in!  Be it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Jobs">Dirty Jobs</a> or
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13833752/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt">Backroad Truckers</a>,
the way that the producers highlight the work always surprises me.  On the other
side of the coin, shows like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Rescue">Bar Rescue</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant:_Impossible">Restaurant Impossible</a>
hit me in a separate way.  Part car crash, part counselling session, it is the
creative aspects of the hosts and how they try and resolve issues that appeal to
me.</p>
<p>And as much as I watch those shows as entertainment, in real life, I do take away
things from watching those shows.</p>
<h2 id="life-is-not-static">Life Is Not Static<a class="headerlink" href="#life-is-not-static" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As with many things in life, I must monitor and adapt to the continually shifting
priorities that are an everyday part of my life.  If I do not do that, one or more parts of my
life suffers, with the underlying issue becoming more difficult to correct with each passing day.
While I have been able to keep my personal life and professional life relatively
well balanced in the last couple of months, it has come at the expense of my side-project
life.</p>
<p>The balance in my personal and professional life is largely in part due to the
support I get from my wife and from the people that I work with.  Right now, my wife
and are I trying to figure out how to make
our house more “us”.  This includes equal parts thinking, trying things out, and just
doing the hard work.  Like any good science guy or engineer, I understand that
failure is not only an option, but it is an exceptionally good teacher.  While I hope for
things to work out on the first attempt, that is almost never the case.  With my
profession, I find that I am only as good as the people that I surround myself
with.  Having good people around me helps me elevate my game and keeps me motivated
to do my best. That and it keeps me on my toes.</p>
<p>If I must be brutally honest, I try and use only a bit of the positive
energy from one part of my life in the other parts of my life. That is not as much
wisdom on my part as it is a safety mechanism.  I can afford to siphon off a bit of
that energy, but I need to ensure that my focus and confidence in each area remains
at a healthy level for me to continue to succeed in life.  Due to
past experiences, I am extermely aware that what I just described as positive
energy and confidence can also apply to negative energy and a lack of confidence.</p>
<p>Looking back at May, the crash that happened was just a shopping cart looking for
a parked car.  Unless it was dealt with properly, it was an accident
that was inevitably going to happen.  Just like the opening acts of the reality
shows that I like watching, to anyone looking at that situation from the outside,
it was obvious that something needed fixing.  But in the moment, I was oblivious.
But due to the way I try and keep the parts of my life seperated, it was mainly
my side-project that suffered.  There was a bit of overlap, that was unavoidable.
But that well-earned wisdom helped me keep an even keel and not shake me up… too
much.</p>
<p>At this point, I am approximately eight weeks past the crash, with most of the serious
stuff from the crash are now behind me.  Currently, my main personal project is to
slowly rework the backyard into something that is relaxing for my wife and I.  Due
to smaller successes and talking things through, I have confidence that we are
moving in a good direction.  In my professional life, I was tasked with doing a lot
of work on another project, with the team lead expressing his confidence in me based
on how he saw me handle small situations.  Based on that feedback and other pieces of
feedback at work, I am confident that I am going in a good direction at work.</p>
<p>On my <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project, it is a
slightly different story.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to admit this, especially to myself, but my confidence in the
project is not even close to where I want it to be.  Normally, I
stagger the work for the different parts of my life to make sure I am giving
each part what is needed for me to be happy and successful in that area.  While
I am getting what I need for the other parts of my life, I am struggling to get
to that same place with the PyMarkdown project.</p>
<p>As I have explained before, that process that I take to author my articles is to
think about things and write down loose notes.  Borrowing from work, I call this
my ideation phase.  I usually write my ideation notes down in a very
technical manner or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness">stream of consciousness</a>
manner, and this week it was stream of consciousness manner. When I performed my
ideation exercise for this week’s article, as soon as I wrote down “confidence?”,
I put my pen down.  Seeing how I was writing the article, I decided to stare at it
for a while and just let it sink in.    The fact that I had
wrote down that word and followed it up with a question mark was a bit stunning
to me.  But as I thought about it more, I could not argue with it.</p>
<p>There were little hints in my behavior that I had missed, but they were there.
In most of the cases, there were small things that I had chalked up to various
legitimate reasons.  What I had not noticed was that I was spending more focus
on those areas, which allowed me to succeed a bit more in those areas.  However,
those successes were at the expense of my side-project work.  Instead of doubling
down and focusing on getting debugging done, I was finding other stuff to do that
did not have to do with the project.  But why?</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a couple of hours, I realized that I was scared. Over
my lifetime, there have been numerous times where I have come close to being
burnt out and at least one time where I burnt out.  When I really, deeply, and
honestly thought about it, I feared burning out.  The fact was, I had a
minor crash that I was able to recover from.  But instead of it being a fight to
get to the point where I crashed, it snuck up on me and ambushed me. Realistically,
I know that is not how it happened, but that is how I felt like it happened.
And bluntly, I was scared that it was going to happen again.</p>
<p>There is an old saying that “one bad apple can spoil the barrel.”  The meaning
behind that saying is that negative things can slowly pollute and degrade the
good things around them over time.  In this case, the negative thing was the
crash and the things to spoil was my confidence.  I got burned by the crash
and I have worked hard to deal with the main effects that happened due to the
crash.  Now that I have a good handle on those, it is time that I deal with
this piece of shrapnel and look for any other pieces that are lying around.</p>
<p>But how do I deal with this lack of confidence in my work on the PyMarkdown
project?
Since these issues only came to me as I was writing this article, I sincerely do
not have an answer to the problem yet. I think that lack of an answer is
comforting to me because I would feel like I was being dishonest with myself
if I just came up with something that might work.  I would rather dedicate
time to think about how to increase my confidence while trying it
out on the project. Anything else would feel cheap and superficial.</p>
<p>Crossing my fingers for the next week. Stay tuned.</p>
