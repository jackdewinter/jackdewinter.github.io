<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2022/07/05/when-are-grab-bags-okay-in-software/">last article</a>, I talked
about the refactoring work I did in the previous week.  This week, I talk about
my progress on adding scenario tests for the nested container scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I am doing any action that is even remotely technical, I think about three
things in quick unison.  What is the cost of doing that action?  What is the benefit
of doing that action?  What are the risks of doing that action?</p>
<p>Having had those questions drilled into my brain for years, they form the basis of what
is known as Risk-Cost-Benefit Analysis.  A quick search with any search engine
turns up multiple hits for articles on the subject, with more hits for the simplified
Cost-Benefit Analysis.</p>
<p>As a Software Development Engineer in Test, one of my primary
tasks is to do these analyses and use automation to mitigate the risks where possible.
Therefore, it should not be a surprise that when I am working on my own projects,
these questions are ones that I ask myself.  Especially after my efforts during
the last week, I believe having a satisfactory answer to those questions regarding the addition
of more scenario tests to
the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-scenario-tests">What Are Scenario Tests?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-scenario-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_testing">definitions</a> of
what scenario tests are, the simplest answer is the one that I give to people that ask
about my work.</p>
<p>User stories are a set of actions where I walk through the
actions that a specific user would do to accomplish a given goal.  A good example of
a user story is “Fred the manager logs on to the web site and requests an activity
report for their direct reports.”  That user story is good because it contains
useful information on the user and what they want to accomplish.</p>
<p>From a project level, user stories are great.  They communicate the intent and goal of
a set of actions that are typical of that user.  But those same stories lack enough
specificity for a software developer to act on.  That is where scenarios
come in.  A scenario is a constrained action that accomplishes a specific goal.
My general rule is that a good scenario usually avoids the word “and” where
possible.  Therefore, breaking down the user story from above, I include scenarios
such as “The user logs on to the website,”
“Manager requests information on direct reports,” and “Manager requests activity
report”.  Each one of these scenarios is integral to the user story, but together
they spell out how the application solves for those user stories.</p>
<p>From there, the jump from a scenario to a scenario test is a simple one.
A scenario test is just a test that clearly focuses on that one scenario. If
possible, interactions with any other scenarios are removed and the focus is
solely on that one scenario.  The success and usefulness of any scenario test is related
to what kind of scenarios it covers and how frequently it needs modification
for unrelated changes.  If it is focused enough on the scenario, those modifications
are usually minimal.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-they-important-to-the-project">Why Are They Important To The Project?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-they-important-to-the-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a web application or a desktop application, the generation of scenarios
deals more with the user interacting with the application than the various parts
of the application itself.  The basis for that assumption is that those application
are primarily created to interact with the end user to provide a desired result.
Therefore, it is that interaction that is central to the scenarios that will make
that application a success.</p>
<p>For backend applications such as the PyMarkdown project, the focus is still on
the user interaction.  However, that user interaction takes place using files or
payloads to be parsed or actioned upon.
Accordingly, the focus in placed on the input that is presented to that application
on behalf of the user.  For the PyMarkdown project, that input is in the form
of Markdown files which have a clearly defined specification that must be adhered
to.</p>
<p>The PyMarkdown Linter is a linting rules engine based on top of a
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">Github Flavored Markdown</a> compliant parser.  The
starting point for the scenario tests was the specification itself.  However, since
the specification focuses on HTML output and the parser focuses on Markdown itself,
I felt that expanding the testing effort to include other Markdown inputs was
warranted.  As each different input is a slightly unique way to “phrase” the
Markdown document, I felt that associating each input with a scenario and a scenario
test was appropriate.</p>
<p>And while I would love for there to be no issues at all with the PyMarkdown
project, I am still finding scenario test failures that I need to deal with.</p>
<h2 id="the-work">The Work<a class="headerlink" href="#the-work" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When it comes those scenario test failures, I have three buckets
that I file those failures into.  The first
bucket is that the application aborts, either from an <code>assert</code> statement or any
other exception that is thrown.  This bucket is a high priority as it will stop
the application from processing anything else in the document.  That, and it also
looks bad to the end user.  The second bucket is for parsing errors that result
in an incorrect Markdown token stream being generated.  These errors are caught
when generating HTML from
the tokens as a double-check.  This bucket is a medium priority because it looks
bad and feels bad since these are very visible to the end-user but are typically
low impact.  Finally, the third bucket is reserved for whitespace errors
that affect the tokens themselves, but only in a minor way.  The tests catch these
errors when generating the original Markdown from the Markdown tokens.  This
bucket is low priority because while there are rules that are dependent on
whitespace in tokens, there are only a handful of them.</p>
<p>Getting back to my work on the project, I started adding a new set of scenario tests
to the project.  After four or five days of work, I had 224 new scenario tests
implemented and committed, with only nine tests failing.  Compared to the work
I did in the spring where I had over fifty tests failing, I was happy with
only having to fix nine tests in two groups.  Honestly, there is a third group that
I need to look at more closely, but I will get to double checking those results
after I deal with the first two groups.</p>
<p>The good news?  Only two of the failing tests were due to parsing errors, the rest
all dealt with whitespace errors.  I found no crashing scenarios and
only a couple of parsing scenarios, with less than ten whitespace scenarios to
fix.  That was a good result.</p>
<p>But should I fix them?  That is the question that I started to ask myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-risk">The Risk<a class="headerlink" href="#the-risk" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Of all three questions, this was the easiest one for me to answer.  The risk of
not having a test for a given scenario is that a user decides not to use the project
for their needs.  However, that risk is balanced out by the frequency of a given
scenario failing in normal use.</p>
<p>Applying those metrics to these scenarios, I would like to reduce the risk if
possible. But nothing that I found made me feel like I had to stop all work and
fix those scenarios right now.  If I make steady work to mitigate the
risk of all three-level nested container scenarios, I am good.  I would feel
better if I had diversity in the scenarios that I am missing, and I need
to be able to factor that into my risk analysis. More on that later.</p>
<h2 id="the-cost">The Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cost" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next question for me to answer was the cost.  Based on my experience of adding
those 224 new scenario tests, I know that it will take me approximately 11 or 12
hours to complete.  That time is not wall-clock time, but active task time.  That
time does not consider any breaks that I take to do work around the house
or to relax between sets of scenario tests.  That time is spent following
a recipe that I determined beforehand.  For this latest group of scenario tests,
which meant taking each existing scenario test and creating three (or four) additional
tests where any indentation for the containers was removed on the last line of
the Markdown.</p>
<p>Another part of the cost is the mental fatigue and boredom.  The task is not
suited for automation, meaning the generation of the scenarios must be done manually.
For this past week, which meant taking over seventy existing scenario tests and performing
that transformation on each test.  That also meant verifying the HTML output against
the canonical <code>commonmark.js</code> parser and fixing any typing errors as I went.  It
was boring, but it needed to be done.</p>
<p>There is also the cost of not adding other scenario tests or addressing other issues.
Often referred to as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp">opportunity cost</a>,
there may be other issues that I could be working on that would solidify the application
more.  That one is harder to quantify, so I keep it in mind as a bit of a tiebreaker.</p>
<h2 id="the-benefit">The Benefit<a class="headerlink" href="#the-benefit" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final question that I need to answer is about the benefit of adding more
scenario coverage.  For me personally, this is more difficult for me to gauge.
When I am using a tool like this, I expect three major things to be in place:
a decent application, a decent issues process, and a decently responsive application
team.  I do not expect applications to be perfect, but the application needs to
show me that the team cares and is being honest with what they believe they can
accomplish.  An “everything working fine” solution that is filled with issues is
a big turn off.  However, the same application with a “we are working to get this
to a better application” sign is perfectly acceptable.  For me, it is all about
setting reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>I have a decent issues process in place and try and be responsive
to any users to file issues.  Based on that opinion, I hope I am okay with not
worrying about disappointing any users in that way.  Therefore, focusing on the
application and its expectations, I am also in decent shape there.  I
believe I have decent documentation and a nice section near the top of the main
page reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="note">Note<a class="headerlink" href="#note" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This project is currently in beta, and some of these documented things may not work 100% as advertised until after the final release. However, everything should be close enough to done that if you find something missing, please let us know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do know that users have asked for improvements and pointed out issues that
they have asked to be fixed, so I have confidence that I am setting the expectations
with my users correctly.</p>
<p>That leaves the determination of value of the benefit in my court.
I will have to think about that some more.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result<a class="headerlink" href="#the-result" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To summarize, from a risk point of view, the amount of risk associated
with hitting significant issues in the remaining “nested three container” scenarios is
medium-to-low.  From a cost point of view, I am confident that adding another
one of the “nested three container” scenario groups is going to take approximately
12 hours to complete, task time.  I am also aware that I am going to get bored with
that process, and that I am going to have to take extra breaks to make sure I stay
on top of my game.  And with the benefit, I am not sure what I am going to land
on that but working through this exercise has helped me out a bit.</p>
<p>I know that there are more than thirty issues in the old issues list, with some more
urgent issues in the current issues list. As issues in the current issues list are
suggestions from users, I feel that any user issues must have a higher priority
than the ones I entered.  From that point of view, there is an opportunity cost
that I am paying in not getting those issues dealt with.  I just do not know how
to weigh any interest in those issues.</p>
<p>To balance that out, I also feel that addressing three groups of scenarios in the
“nested three container” scenarios group would help me reduce my estimated risk
from medium-to-low to low.  The first group of these scenarios revolves around
the whitespace before list items.  For example, does this Markdown parse
correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="n">one</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="n">two</span>
  <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="n">three</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Those scenarios, an add-on to the work that I just completed, would increase my
confidence that I have the list item support working properly in the parser. The
other two groups of scenarios are variations on:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For me, replicating my recent work (with the addition of the above group) on those
two sets of scenarios would give me confidence that I have addressed the highest
risk scenarios.</p>
<p>For me, reducing the risk that I have missed something is worth the benefit,
if I can respond to user requests.  I think.</p>
<h2 id="and-that-means">And That Means…<a class="headerlink" href="#and-that-means" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>So given all that hand-waving… I am going to think about this for a week or
two as I try to fix the issues that came up during the last week.  That will
allow me to make progress that I know will bring the project benefit while
giving me some more time to figure out how I feel about the above decision.</p>
<p>There is lots of work to do, and I do not have any pressure to
make a speedy decision, just a good decision.</p>
