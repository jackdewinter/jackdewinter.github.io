<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Part of any project I do, private or open-source, is to set up a version control system and
securing access to that version control system.  In addition, it is always a high priority for
me to make sure that the secure access follows best common practices on security, as it is
protecting work that I am doing.  Using Git as my version control system of choice, and GitHub
as the open source repository host of choice, it made logical sense to make my website platform
of choice GitHub Pages<sup id="fnref:GitHubPages"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GitHubPages">3</a></sup>.  As such, in setting up this website I needed to make sure
I had Git<sup id="fnref:Git"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Git">1</a></sup> and more specifically GitHub <sup id="fnref:GitHub"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:GitHub">2</a></sup> setup, and setup securely.</p>
<p>This article details the actions and choices I made in setting up my access to GitHub for my
blog.  It details how I followed the GitHub Pages instructions for creating a personal website
and creating a personal repository on GitHub to achieve that.  Then it describes the two modes
of accessing GitHub, SSH and HTTPS, and why I chose SSH.  Finally, it provides detailed notes
on how I generated a SSH keypair specifically for GitHub, and configured both my local Git and
the remote GitHub to use them.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-github">Getting Started With GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-with-github" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many good articles out there on how to install Git for different operating systems,
so I feel it is safe to assume that anyone reading this can do the research needed to install
Git for their operating system.  Setting up access to GitHub is even easier, as the folks at
GitHub have provided excellent instructions.  Start the setup by simply going to the
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub Home Page</a> and following their instructions.</p>
<p>The pivotal part is that to start using GitHub in a serious manner, you need to authenticate
yourself to the GitHub servers.  Thus, the workflow will either allow you to login, if you
already have an account, or create a new account, if you don’t have an account.  Having already
dealt with a couple of open source projects, I logged on to my account <code>jackdewinter</code> without
any issues.</p>
<p>After I logged in, the browser deposited me on my home page.  From there I was able to see
any projects that I had either contributed to or filed an issue against.  Just starting in my
Open Source journey, the contents were only a couple of projects that I had filed issues with.
Prior to this point, I had no need to authenticate my Git client with GitHub as I was just
downloading from public repositories.  Having done some research on GitHub Pages, I knew that
setting up my own website with GitHub would require me to create my own repositories.  As
such, my next task was to create that repository.</p>
<h2 id="creating-my-first-github-repository">Creating My First GitHub Repository<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-my-first-github-repository" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages home page</a> has a really simple formula on their
webpage for setting up personal webpages.  The first step is pretty easy: make sure that
that the name of the repository is my GitHub user id (in my case <code>jackdewinter</code>) followed by
<code>.github.io</code>.  When the creation of my repository finished, GitHub deposited my browser
at the base of my new repository: <code>jackdewinter/jackdewinter.github.io</code>.  The remaining steps in
the formula dealt with cloning the repository, defining a sample
<code>index.html</code> file for the website, and pushing that code back to the repository.  While I was
familiar with those concepts, I wasn’t shy about checking back with the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">Git Basics documentation</a>
on the Git website when I forgot something.  From there I was able to find the correct helper
article on what I need to accomplish within 2-3 clicks.</p>
<p>In GitHub, unless you mark a repository as private, everyone can see that
repository and read from that repository.  As my website’s repository is public, reading
wasn’t a problem.  However, pushing the code back to my repository would be writing, and that
was a problem. Each GitHub project has a list of who can write to it and the creator of the
project is on that list by default.  But to write to the project, I needed my local Git tool
to login to GitHub when needed and authenticate itself.  To do this securely, I was going to
have to dive into credentials.</p>
<h2 id="github-authentication-ssh-vs-https">GitHub Authentication: SSH vs HTTPS<a class="headerlink" href="#github-authentication-ssh-vs-https" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any time you log in to a website or to a program to gain specific privileges, you establish
your credentials by supplying your user id and password.  You tell the website or program “I
can prove I am me, let me see my stuff!”.  The GitHub website is no different that any of
those sites.  If you want to be able to see any of your private stuff or write to your stuff,
it needs to verify who you are.</p>
<p>Going to the
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">Authenticating with GitHub from Git</a>,
there are two choices that allow us to connect to GitHub: HTTPS and SSH.  Both of these are
valid options, allowing for enhanced security when Git connects to GitHub.  Each of these
options has different things going for and against it.  After doing some
research, it seemed to me to break down to the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>SSH</th>
<th>HTTPS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>set up keys</td>
<td>set up credential manager</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>setup is more involved</td>
<td>easy setup</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>more secure</td>
<td>less likely blocked by firewall</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Looking at this information, I decided to go with SSH as I wanted to opt for more security.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-access-to-github">SSH Access to GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-access-to-github" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>During my research at the GitHub site, I found this very good page on
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/using-ssh-over-the-https-port">SSH over the HTTPS port</a>.
In it, they explain that there is a simple test to see if SSH will work from your system to
GitHub.  When you execute the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh -T git@github.com
</pre></div>
<p>it will either return one of two responses.  If it returns with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; Hi *username*! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</pre></div>
<p>then you can access GitHub via SSH without any issues.  If you see the other response:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
</pre></div>
<p>then you have to setup SSH to connect to GitHub over the HTTPS port.  This access can be
verified with a small modification to the above command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
</pre></div>
<p>The command is now trying to establish a SSH session over port 443, and if you get the
<code>You've successfully...</code> response, it’s working fine.  Running these tests myself, I found
that I got a timeout on the first command and a success on the second command.  Following
the article, it recommends changes to <code>~/.ssh/config</code><sup id="fnref:SSH_CONFIG"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SSH_CONFIG">4</a></sup> to include the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
</pre></div>
<p>The next time, when I executed the <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> command, the response was
the <code>You've successfully</code> response.  Now I was ready to set up the SSH keys.</p>
<h2 id="unique-ssh-keys">Unique SSH Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#unique-ssh-keys" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Going back to the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">Authenticating with GitHub from Git</a>,
the next step was to generate a new SSH key pair and add it to the local SSH keyring.  The page
that points to
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">generating a new key</a>
is pretty detailed, so I won’t try and improve over GitHub’s work.  On my reading of the page,
it seems to assume that if you will only have 1 key pair<sup id="fnref:keypair"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:keypair">5</a></sup> generated and that you will
reuse that key pair for GitHub.  I have issues with that practice, so I want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Having a bit of a security background from my day job, I want to limit exposure if something
gets broken.  Just from a quick search, there are articles by
<a href="https://askleo.com/why-is-it-so-important-to-use-a-different-password-on-every-site/">Leo Notenboom</a>,
<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2017/05/dont-need-27-different-passwords/">Malware Bytes Labs</a>, and
<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Have-Many-Different-Passwords-for-Many-Different-Websites">WikiHow</a>
that all describe how you should have different passwords for each account, and in many cases,
use a password manager.  And to be honest, that was just the first 3 that I clicked on.  There
were a lot more.  </p>
<p>I can sum up and paraphrase the justification raised in each of those articles by posing a
single question: If someone breaks your password on one site, what is your exposure?  If you
have one password for all sites, then whoever breaks your password has access to that one
site.  If you have a different password for each site, the damage is limited to one site,
instead of all sites using that password.</p>
<p>In my mind, using a key pair for credentials is a similar concept to using a user-id and
password for credentials.  Therefore, it followed that if I follow good security practices for
passwords, I should also follow the same practices for key pairs as credentials.</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-new-key-for-github">Generating a New Key For GitHub<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-a-new-key-for-github" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To ensure I have secure access to GitHub, I followed the instructions
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">for generating a new key</a>.
To generate a distinct key pair for GitHub, I made one small modification to the instructions:
I saved the new key pair information with the filename <code>github-key</code> instead of the default
<code>id_ras</code>.  This resulted in the files <code>~/.ssh/github-key</code> and <code>~/.ssh/github-key.pub</code>
being created as the key pair.  With those files created, I followed the remaining
instructions for setting up ssh-agent and uploading the key information to GitHub, replacing
any occurrence of <code>id_ras</code> with <code>github-key</code>.</p>
<p>With that accomplished, I had a specific key pair specifically for GitHub and it was
registered locally.
I also had setup GitHub with the public portion of the credentials using the contents of
<code>~/.ssh/github-key.pub</code>, as instructed.  The only remaining step was ensure that any SSH
connections to GitHub would use the GitHub credentials. Doing a bit more research on the SSH
configuration files, I quickly found that there was built in support for this by adding the
following to my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  User git
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile /c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key
</pre></div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The location of <code>~/</code> on my Windows machine is <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\</code> or <code>c:\Users\jackd\</code>.  The format for the <code>IdentityFile</code> property is a standard Unix path format.  This requires a translation from the Windows path format <code>C:\Users\jackd\.ssh\github-key</code> to the Unix path format of <code>/c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Combined with the change from earlier in this article, my <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file now looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Host github.com
  Hostname ssh.github.com
  Port 443
  User git
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile /c/Users/jackd/.ssh/github-key
</pre></div>
<h2 id="testing-against-github-github-pages">Testing Against GitHub: GitHub Pages<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-against-github-github-pages" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having performed a number of thorough tests of the above steps, everything passed without any
issues!  Now it was time to try and push some commits for the blog to GitHub.</p>
<p>To create a directory for the GitHub project, I largely followed
<a href="static-2.md#Create a Project Directory For The Site">these instructions</a>
detailed in the companion article on setting up your own static website.  I then followed
<a href="static-5.md### Attaching Remote Repositories to Local Repositories">these instructions</a>,
adding the remote repository to my local configuration with the following line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add origin jackdewinter/jackdewinter.github.io
</pre></div>
<p>Having associated the directory with the remote repository, the final test was to make a
change to the directory, commit it, and push it to the remote.  For this test, I used a
very simple <code>index.html</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
Hello world!
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">html</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Adding the file to the directory, I staged the file and committed it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add index.html
git commit -m <span class="s2">"new files"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and then pushed it to the remote repository with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh-agent
git push origin master --force
</pre></div>
<p>Crossing my fingers, I waited until I got a response similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Counting objects: XXX, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (XX/XX), done.

   XXXXXX..XXXXXX  master -&gt; master
</pre></div>
<p>With no error messages, I double checked the repository at
<code>https://github.com/jackdewinter/jackdewinter.github.io</code> and was able to see the <code>index.html</code>
file present in the repository.  Following through with the instructions for GitHub Pages, I
then went to <code>https://jackdewinter.github.io</code> and was able to see the text “Hello world!” on
in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-accomplished">What Was Accomplished<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-accomplished" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This article started with my creation of a GitHub repository to contain
the files for my personal website using GitHub Pages.  To securely access the repository, I
chose the SSH protocol and discovered that I needed to employ SSH over HTTP.  For enhanced
security, I described a solid reason for wanting a unique SSH key for GitHub.  Following that
advice, I generated a new key and then changed the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to use SSH over HTTPS
and to point to that newly generated keypair.  Finally, I committed a sample file to the
project and was able to see it pushed successfully to the remote repository, and displayed as
my personal home page.</p>
