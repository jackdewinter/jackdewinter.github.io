            <p>Growing up in the late 70s and early 80s, the only computers that were available to me
at the time were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore</a> line of
computers locked up in schools.  To feed my growing and inquiring mind, that left
electronics and mechanics to experiment with, and expendable examples of both were hard
to come by.  My only choice was to scrounge around for things in various stages of
disrepair, and upon getting one of those uncommon finds, take it downstairs to our
unheated garage and trying to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; it.  Far from a stellar place to work, it was not
heated, not ventilated and rarely keep clean.  And at the head of that garage, on the
wall adjoining the basement, was a solitary, ugly workbench fastened to the wall.</p>
<p>That workbench was often the birthplace of many far-fetched dreams of what I could do if
only I could properly figure the thing laid out before me.  I almost never had the right
tools, so to be totally honest, more things got &ldquo;more broken&rdquo; than ever got fixed or
reassembled into something else.  Even with the right tools, while I believe my ability
to make it work again would have increased, the drive and knowledge to do so was
probably not there.  But even with a veritable graveyard of things that were not
completed, I chose not to dwell on the failures or make excuses for why I didn&rsquo;t finish
them.  Instead, every time I approached that bench, I chose to dream and move forward.</p>
<p>Looking back, I fondly remember the times I stood at that bench with the single, bright
work light in my eyes.  Back then, it was always the journey and the creative
imagination that was important.  The only pressure to produce something concrete was
when my mom asked &ldquo;So, what have you been working on?&rdquo;  However, as I grew older, I
realized that my mom&rsquo;s question was equal parts sincere interest on her part and her
desire to have me grow past that graveyard of unfinished projects.  I believe that she
wanted me to be able to channel that creativity into the something tangible. Not so she
could show off my work to others, but in a sincere effort to help me grow.</p>
<p>Things are a lot different some 40 years later.  Even though I longer use that old
workbench, I try and capture a lot of that creativity and wonder on a daily basis, both
in my professional life and home life.  The projects I undertake are no longer
far-fetched, but grounded in reality.  As a result, I am better at selecting the projects
that I want to work on and I am more successful in carrying them to completion.
When a project fails, I embrace one of the Mythbuster&rsquo;s idioms,
<a href="https://mygeekwisdom.com/2016/01/09/failure-is-always-an-option/">&ldquo;Failure is always an option&rdquo;</a>
and try and learn what failed and how to deal with it next time.  While a small number of
projects till end up in my project graveyard, but I keep the larger number of successful
projects on proud display in my workplace and my house.</p>
<p>So why start a blog and call it &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s Digital Workbench&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that I started blogging to help me keep a digital form of that
garage workbench alive and renewed.  I want to inspire people in the same way that my
mother has done in the past and continues to do so today.  I want to inspire people to
dream big, following each dream up with a grounding that enables them to work on that
project and gain confidence in their skills along the way.  I want to inspire people to
try and take something on, taking any failures along the way as teaching or learning
moments and not as dream killers.</p>
<p>Basically, the reason for Jack&rsquo;s Digital Workbench is to communicate with others and to
inspire them in a positive manner to allow them to, in turn, inspire the people around
them.</p>
