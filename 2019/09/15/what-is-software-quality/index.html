<p>When introducing myself to someone professionally, I usually start with the normal
“Hi, my name is …” that is boiler-plated on nametags the world over.  Getting past that
initial point, if the person is so inclined, they ask that always fun lead off question “So,
what do you?”  For me, I always respond with “I am an SDET”<sup id="fnref:SDET"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SDET">1</a></sup>, to which anyone not in the
software industry replies back with “Um.... What is that?”</p>
<p>Spewing out “It means I am a Software Development Engineer in Test.”, I wait for the response
that most people use: “Oh, so you are a tester.”  Often with gritted teeth, I try and explain
that testing is only a small part of what I do.  If I think they are still listening, I
given them my quick elevator pitch that emphasizes that I focus on helping to produce good
quality software by helping to increase the quality of the teams, the projects, and the
processes that I am tasked to assist with.</p>
<p>Approximately 60-70% the time I win people over
with the elevator pitch, and a pleasant conversation continues.  The next 20-30% of the time,
usually with people not in the software field, I get blank stares and they fixate on the
“test” in the title rather than the “quality” in my description.  The remaining people are
usually Software Development Engineers or SDEs<sup id="fnref:SDE"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SDE">2</a></sup> that for one reason or another, start to
tune out.</p>
<p>For the percentage of people that I win over, they seem to understand that I focus on quality,
but the follow up question is almost always: “What does quality software mean to you?”</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-do-we-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>For me, I almost always start at the beginning with requirements.  Whether they are
spoken or written down, each project has a set of requirements.  It could be the requirements
are to “explore my ability to use X” or “fix the X in the Y project” or “create a project
that can help me X”, but every project has requirements.</p>
<p>In the software development industry, requirements are often presented
to teams that are hard to deal with or are left to the developers to write themselves.  This
practice is so prolific that Scott Adam’s Dilbert site has pages and pages of instance where
<a href="https://dilbert.com/search_results?terms=User%20Requirements">requirements are talked about</a>.
One example is when a manager talks to their team and
informs them that some process needs to be faster by 5%.  Do they have enough information from
that manager to understand the context of the requirement?  Do they expect that increase by a
specific time to meet their own goals?  What does that requirement look like?  How do they
know when they have achieved it?  Is it achievable?  If it is achievable, how do they measure
progress towards that goal?  These are some of the core questions that I believe need
answering.</p>
<p>As those questions are at the front of my mind, when someone asks me how I define software quality, the first thing I immediately think back to is a course that I once took on setting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">S.M.A.R.T. requirements</a>.
In that class, the main focus was on taking unrefined requirements and curating them to a
point where they could be more readily be acted upon.  The instructor made a very good
argument that each requirement must be Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and
Time-Related.</p>
<p>When it comes to software quality, I believe those same questions needs to be asked with
regards to any of the requirements teams put on their software.  But to ask those questions
properly, we need to have some context in which to ask those questions.  To establish that
context, it is helpful to have some guidelines to provide a framework for the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-some-guidelines-the-four-pillars">Establishing Some Guidelines: The Four Pillars<a class="headerlink" href="#establishing-some-guidelines-the-four-pillars" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A good general article for anyone interested in software quality is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality#Measurement">Wikipedia article on Software Quality</a>.
In fact, when asked by people where to get started in the software quality area, I often refer
them to this article solely because of the excellent diagram in the Measurements section on the
right side of the page.<sup id="fnref:Pillars"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Pillars">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The diagram in the Measurements section correlates very closely to what I believe are the four
pillars of software quality: Reliability, Maintainability, Efficiency, and Security.  The
diagram then shows how their pillars relate to other attributes: Application Architecture
Standards, Coding Practices, Complexity, Documentation, Portability, and Technical/Functional
Volumes.  From there, it provides more lists of how to break things down, with many references
to other articles.  In short, it is a great place to start from.</p>
<h2 id="measuring-software-quality">Measuring Software Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-software-quality" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before proceeding to talk about the pillars themselves, I feel strongly that we need to
discuss the categories that I use for measuring the metrics talked about in the Wikipedia
article.  My intention is that by talking about the metrics before discussing each of the
pillars, you can start building a mental model of how to apply them to your projects as you
are reading about them.  From my point of view, making that mental transition from something
abstract that you read about to something concrete that applies to your work is
essential to serious forward momentum on software quality.</p>
<p>These metrics typically fall into two categories: seldom violated metrics and positive
momentum metrics.</p>
<p>The seldom violated metrics category contains rules that define rules that are pivotal to the
quality of your project.  Each rule are a combination of a given metric and a maximum
or minimum weighed against that metric.  As a guideline, teams should only ignore
these rules on a case by case basis after providing a reason that is good, defensible, and
documented.
Examples of such metrics are Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Static Code Analysis
(SCA) results, and Test Failure Rates.  Examples of rules are “the TP99 for the X
API is Y millisecond” or “all PMD warnings (Java SCA tool) must be following with
a minimal of suppressions”.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to make these rules useful and to keep your
team honest, your team needs to publish the selected metrics, with a description of what the
metrics are, how your team measures those metrics, and why your team is measuring them.</p>
<p>The positive momentum metrics category is usually reserved for metrics that are being
introduced to an already existing project.  When introducing software quality metrics into an
already existing project, it is not realistic to expect those metrics to be adhered to in an
instant.  It is more realistic to expect positive momentum towards the goal
until the point when your team achieves it, at which point is moves to the desired seldom
violated metrics category.  As such, a measure of the momentum of these metrics is used, and is
hopefully in a positive direction. Similar to the previous category, your team should publish
information about the selected metrics, with the added information on when your team feels
they will translate it from the positive momentum category to the seldom violated category.</p>
<p>Being consistent on these chosen metrics is very important.  While dropping a metric looks
better on any reporting in the short term, it usually negatively impacts the software quality,
perhaps in a way that is not obvious until later. Adding a new metric will show lower the
measured quality in the short term, but increases the measured quality in the long
term.  Your team can negate the short term impact by paying the immediate cost of making the
new metric a seldom violated metric, but that has to be weighed against the other priorities
for your project.  As with everything, it is a balancing act that needs to be negotiated with
your team.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-four-pillars">Exploring The Four Pillars<a class="headerlink" href="#exploring-the-four-pillars" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having established that S.M.A.R.T. requirements and the two categories for metrics
from the previous sections are useful in measuring software quality, the focus of the article
can return to the guidelines: the four pillars.  Each one of these pillars will look at
your software project from a different angle, with the goal of providing a set of data points
to formulate a coherent measurement of software quality for that project.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I strive to describe each of the four pillars, providing a jumping
off point to another article that describes that pillar in a more comprehensive manner.  I
firmly believe that by providing metrics for each pillar that are specific to your project,
with each of those metrics properly categorized into the two measurement categories documented
above, that your team will take a decent step forward in clearly defining software quality for
your project.</p>
<h3 id="reliability">Reliability<a class="headerlink" href="#reliability" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The essence of this pillar can be broken down into two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the software do the task that it is supposed to do?</li>
<li>Does the software execute that task in a consistent manner?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliability is one of the areas in which “pure” testing shines.  A lot of the tests that
SDEs, SDETs, and testers are asked to write specifically verify if a given object does
what it is supposed to do.  Unit tests determine whether an individual software unit, such as
a class, performs they way it is supposed to.  Functional tests or integration tests take that
a step higher, determining whether a group of related software units do what they are supposed
to do.  Another step higher are the scenario tests, which determine whether the software
project, as a whole, responds properly to various use cases or scenarios that are considered
critical to its operation.  Finally, end-to-end tests or acceptance tests determine whether or
not a group of projects respond properly from an end user’s perspective.</p>
<p>This pattern is so widely used, any search for
<a href="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=test+pyramid">test pyramid</a>,
will find many variations of the same theme. Different articles on the subject will stress
different points about the pyramid, but they will all generally look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="test pyramid" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/quality-1/test-pyramid.png"/></p>
<p>This pyramid, or other similar pyramids, are interpreted by authors to indicate a specific
things about the tests, to highlight the position of their article.  Some of these
interpretations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>An article on test volume will typically stress that ~70-80% of the tests should be at the unit test level, ~10-15% at the functional test level, ~5-10% at the scenario level, and ~1-3% at the end-to-end level.</li>
<li>An article on test frequency will typically stress that tests near the bottom of the pyramid should complete within 60 seconds and be executed every time the source code is checked in.  Tests near the top of the pyramid may take minutes or hours and should be executed once a week.</li>
<li>An article on test fragility will typically stress that tests near the bottom of the pyramid are closer to their components, the expectation is that they will not fail.  Tests near the top of the pyramid require more orchestration between projects and teams, and therefore, are more likely to failure do to environmental or other reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>While all of these interpretations have merit, the critical point for me is the issue of
boiling down that information to a small number of bite sized observations that can be easily
measured and communicated. In the upcoming article <code>Software Quality: Reliability</code>, I will
delve more into breaking the Reliability pillar into S.M.A.R.T. requirements and I provide
suggestions on how it can be measured.</p>
<h3 id="maintainability">Maintainability<a class="headerlink" href="#maintainability" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The essence of this pillar can be broken down into one question:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are asked to change the software to fix a bug or introduce a new feature, how easy is it to change the software, how many surprises do you expect to encounter, and how confident will you be about the change afterwards?</li>
</ul>
<p>The best, and most comedic, form of asking this question is captured by this cartoon
from <a href="https://www.osnews.com/">OSNews</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="WTFs per minute" src="https://mk0osnewswb2dmu4h0a.kinstacdn.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg"/></p>
<p>Maintainability is a single pillar that encompasses the most diverse types of processes and
measurements of any of the pillars.  The reason for this is that maintainability is often a
word that is used without a lot of provided context.  For me, a good way to think about
maintainability is that it is the cleanliness of your project.  Different people will have
different experiences, and after asking different people about how “clean” the project is,
the collected answers will almost certainly by different.</p>
<p>Try this in your office with your colleagues.  Point to a given area of your office and ask
2-5 people how clean a given area, such as your desk is.  Instead of accepting a single
answer, dig in a bit as to why they answered the way they did.  Most likely, you will
get as many distinct answers as people that you talk to.  This exercise illustrates how
hard it is to give a good answer to how maintainable software a given piece of software is.</p>
<p>The best way to provide metrics for maintainability is usually with various Static Code
Analysis tools.  Almost every mature language has at least one tool to do this, and each tool
usually measures a fair number of metrics.  These metrics will use established (and sometimes
experimental) industry practices to look at the source code of your project and determine
if there are issues that can be addressed.  In addition to those metrics, those same tools
often look for “problematic” and “sloppy” code.  Problematic code is usually some manner of
pattern that a fair number of experts have agreed is a bad thing, such as appending to a
string within a loop.  Sloppy code is usually things like having a variable or a parameter
that is not being used, or a forgotten comment on a public method.</p>
<p>In addition to Static Code Analysis, teams must continue to strive to have a good set of
documentation on what the project is doing, and regularly maintain that documentation.  While
the “correctness” of the documentation is harder to measure than source code, it is pivotal
for a project. How much of the information on the various projects that your team supports
is in the head of one or two individuals?  What is going to happen if they leave the team
or leave the company.</p>
<p>Your team should not need volumes of information on every decision that was made, but as a
team, it is imperative to document the major decisions that affect the flow of the project.
It is also a good idea to have solid documentation on building, deploying, and executing
the project. Imagine yourself as a new team member looking at the software project and any
documentation, and honestly ask yourself “How much would I want to run away from that project?”
If the honest answer from each member of the team is something similar to “I’m good”, you
probably have a decent level of documentation.</p>
<h4 id="a-note-on-static-code-analysis">A Note On Static Code Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-on-static-code-analysis" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before delving deeper into maintainability, I want to take a minute to talk about Static Code
Analysis.
Typically, Static Code Analysis is used as a gatekeeper for maintainability, and as such,
any suggestions should be strictly followed.  However, Static Code Analysis tends to be an
outlier to the gatekeeper rule in that the metrics need to be “bent” every so often. This
“bending” is accomplished using some form of suppression specified by the Analyzer itself.</p>
<p>Static Code Analyzers tend to fall into two main categories: style and correctness.</p>
<p>Any warnings that are generated by a style analyzer should be addressed without fail.
In terms of stylistics, there are very few times where deviating from a common style are
beneficial, and as such should be avoided.  As stylistics can vary from person to
person when writing code, it is useful to supplement the style analyzer with an IDE
plugin that will reformat the source code to meet the team’s stylistics, with the Static
Code Analyzer acting as a backstop in case the IDE formatting fails.</p>
<p>Warnings generated by correctness analyzers are more likely to require bending.  Most
correctness analyzers are based on rules that are normally correct, but do have exceptions.
As such, your team should deal with these exception by having a follow up rule on when
it is acceptable to suppress the exceptions, and specifically on a case-by-case basis.
It is also acceptable to suppress the exception after generating a future requirement to
address the exception, if your team is diligent on following up with these requests.</p>
<p>In both cases, it is important to remember that SCAs are used to help your team
keep the project’s maintainability at a healthy level.</p>
<h4 id="back-to-maintainability">Back to Maintainability<a class="headerlink" href="#back-to-maintainability" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the upcoming article <code>Software Quality: Maintainability</code>, I will delve more into breaking
the Maintainability pillar into S.M.A.R.T. requirements and I provide suggestions on how it can
be measured.  I will do this by presenting the 4-5 metrics that I consider to be useful as
well as both patterns and anti-patterns to avoid. [ED: Need to rephrase that last sentence.]</p>
<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#efficiency" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The essence of this pillar can be broken down into one question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the software execute that task in a timely manner?</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to my analogy of maintainability being the cleanliness of your software, efficiency
is whether or not your software is executing “fast enough”.  Coming up with an answer to a
question on whether or not something is “fast enough” is usually pretty easy.  But when
you ask for a definition of what “fast enough” means, that is when people start to have issues
coming up with a solid answer.  In my experience, a large part of the reason for that
vagueness is usually not having a good set of requirements.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s figure out what “fast enough” means for two different video games that
my family plays: Civilization and Rocket League.</p>
<p>For the game Civilization (in multiplayer mode), the big delays in the game are the human
interactions and decisions required before a player ends their turn.  It is
also very important that all of the information get conveyed between turns so that the
multiplayer server can accurately record actions in a fair and just manner.  For this game,
“fast enough” for the software is largely dwarfed by the delays that the players introduce.
However, if we have a game with 12 players, 2 of them human and the other 10 using the game’s
AI players, then we can start to formulate what “fast enough” is for the AI players.  It
really depends on the context.</p>
<p>Rocket League is a different story.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League">Rocket League</a>
is a sequel to the game “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars” released in 2008.
In this game, you play a game of arena soccer using rocket powered cars, each match consisting
of a series of games between teams of 1-3 players.  Unless there is a LAN tournament between
professional teams, it is very rare for more than one player to be in the immediate vicinity
of their teammates, and often players are from different states/provinces and even countries.
For the client software on the player’s computers, “fast enough” is measured by latency and
packet loss.  With each player’s action being relayed to the server and then back out to the
other players, any packet loss or increase in latency will impact the server’s reaction to
various inputs from the player’s controllers.  For this type of game, “fast enough” depends
on a good network connection and a server that is able to process many actions per second.</p>
<p>As you can see from the video game example, efficiency greatly depends on what the requirements
of the software are.  In the upcoming article <code>Software Quality: Efficiency</code>, I will delve
more into breaking the Efficiency pillar into S.M.A.R.T. requirements and I provide
suggestions on how it can be measured.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The essence of this pillar can be broken down into one question:</p>
<ul>
<li>How easy is it for a third party to perform malicious actions with your software?</li>
</ul>
<p>That is one dramatic question.  “Perform malicious actions.”  Wow!  I have read all sorts
of articles on various news sites about those, but surely they cannot affect my software?
That is usually one of the first reactions of a lot of software developers.  Just 10
minutes with a security researcher can open your eyes to what is possible.</p>
<p>To understand this better, pretend that your software project is on a slide, being viewed
through a microscope.  If you look at the slide without the microscope, you just see your
software on the slide, pretty much the same as any other slide.  However, if you increase your
magnification by one order of magnitude, you see that your project includes your source code
and components developed by other people.  You may be following proper security practices, but
did they?</p>
<p>Another order of magnitude down, and you are looking at the low level instructions for your
project and any included components.  Once the component was assembled, could a third party
have added some malicious code to that component, executing normally until they activate it?
Was that malicious code in their from the beginning?  Or maybe it is a vulnerability at the
source code, machine code, or machine levels?  Someone can make a small change to a component
to utilize that vulnerability with little effort if they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Reversing our direction, if we expand outwards instead of inwards, we have containerization.
Containerization solutions, such as <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">Docker</a>,
provides a complete computing environment to execute your software within.  Popular with back
end development, you encapsulate your software with it’s intended operating system platform,
reducing the number of platform’s you need to design your software for to 1.  But with
containerization, we also have to ask the same questions of the platform as we did with the
software.  How secure is the operating system that the container uses as it’s base?</p>
<p>In today’s world of software development, where componentization is key, the software you
write is not the only place where security issues can be introduced.  However, there are
proactive steps you can take to reduce the vectors than users can
follow to use your software maliciously.
In the upcoming article <code>Software Quality: Security</code>, I will delve more into breaking
the Security pillar into S.M.A.R.T. requirements and I provide suggestions on how they it
be measured.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-requirements">Back To Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#back-to-requirements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having explored the 4 pillars, it is important to bring the discussion back to the definition
of good requirements.  Using the information from each of the individual pillar articles in
concert with the information on S.M.A.R.T. terminology, your team can request requirements
that are more focused.  As any focused requirements will be Specific (the S. in S.M.A.R.T.),
it is reasonable to expect that any impact on our 4 pillars will be noted.  Asking for this
change will almost guarantee some negotiations with the team’s stakeholders.</p>
<p>In my experience, when your team asks for more focused goals from your stakeholders, there
will typically be some pushback from those stakeholders at the beginning.  If your team
has had some requirements mishaps in the past, highlight each mishap and how the ensuing
loss of time and focus could have been avoided usually sways stakeholders.  Don’t point
fingers, but simply point out something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, when we did the X requirement, we all had a different idea on what to fix, and as such,it took X hours of meeting and Y hours of coding and testing to figure out it was the wrong thing.  We just want to help tune the requirements process a bit to help everyone try and avoid that waste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most stakeholders are being asked to have their teams do the maximum amount of work possible
in the shortest amount of time. By asking that question in such simple manner, you are asking
if you can spend a small amount of time up front to hopefully eliminate any such missteps.
Most stakeholders will grab on to that as a way for them to look good and for the team to
look good, a win-win.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-these-requirements-look-like">What will these requirements look like?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-will-these-requirements-look-like" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The requirements will typically come in two main categories.  The first category, requirements
focused on fixing bugs or adding features, will typically be the bulk of the requirements.
Each requirement should outline any negative impact it will have on any of the metrics.  If
nothing is added on negative impacts, the assumption is that the impact will be neutral or
positive.</p>
<p>A good example of this is a requirement to add a new feature to the project.  The requirement
should be clearly stated using S.M.A.R.T. terminology, because it will remove any
ambiguity in the requirements.  As any source code added without tests would impact any
reliability metrics, reliability tests should be added to meet any seldom violated
metrics for your project.  In similar ways for the other 3 pillars, it is assumed that any
source code added will be a step forward or neutral in terms of quality, not backward.</p>
<p>At some point in your project, you should expect that at least a few of the requirements
will appear in the the second category: requirements specifically targeted at one or more of
the pillars.  These requirements allow your team to focus on some aspect of your project where
your team feels that the quality can be improved.  The big caveat with these
requirements is to be mindful of the Achievable and Time-Related aspects of S.M.A.R.T.
requirements.  Make sure that whatever the goal of these requirements are, they are things
that won’t go on forever and are not pipe dreams.</p>
<p>A good example of this is wanting to improve the efficiency of your project or processes.
Without a good requirements that is Specific, Achievable and Time-Related, this can go on
forever. A bad requirement would state something like “Make the project build faster”.  A good
requirement might state something like “Reduce the unit test time from 20 seconds to
under 15 seconds”, timeboxed to 4 hours.  The good requirement has good guard rails on it
to keep it from exploding on someone who picks up that work.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-software-quality">Publishing Software Quality<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing-software-quality" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having gone through the previous sections and any related articles, you should have a
better idea on:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to write better requirements to ask for software quality to be improved</li>
<li>what metrics I recommend to use for each of the four pillars</li>
<li>how to measure those metrics and integrate them into your projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this information as tools, your team can improve the quality of the project at it’s own
pace, be that either an immediate focus or a long term focus for your project.</p>
<p>For any metrics that are in the seldom violated category, the best way to approach them is
to make them gatekeeper metrics for your project.  It should be possible to execute a great
many of the gatekeeper metrics before a commit happens, which is optimal.  For the remaining
metrics in the seldom violated category and metrics in the the positive momentum category,
your team should publish those metrics with every commit or push, giving the submitter that
needed feedback.</p>
<p>In addition, publishing the metrics to some kind of data store allows your team to
determine how the project quality is trending over time, allowing any stakeholders or project
members to observe any potential software quality issues and take steps to deal with them.
Even for certain seldom violated metrics, it can be useful to track how they are trending,
even if they are trending above the gatekeeper lines set for the project.</p>
<p>If your team does not publish those metrics in some form, the only data point they have for
the project is a binary one: it passes or it does not.  From my experience, that binary
metric is often a false positive that burns teams due to a lack of information.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-software-quality-mean-to-me">What Does Software Quality Mean To Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-software-quality-mean-to-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Software quality means each software project has a plan.  When requirements come in to the
project, they are detailed using the S.M.A.R.T. terminology.  If not specifically geared
towards a given software quality pillar, each requirement may specify what kind of impact it
has on one or more of the pillars.  If not specified, it is assumed that it has a neutral or
positive effect on all of the software quality pillars.  The goals are also specific, not
overly broad, and realistically achieved within a given time frame.</p>
<p>Software quality means that metrics are well thought out for each project.  Each metric is
both defensible and reasonable for that project and that team.  Any metrics that are not being
used as gatekeepers are published so they can be tracked over time.  For additional benefit,
non-binary gatekeeper metrics are also published, to further improve the project and the
quality of the project.</p>
<p>Software quality means ensuring that software projects are reliable.  Projects have well
thought out tests that are performed at many levels to ensure that the project’s components
work together to meet the project requirements as well as verify the correctness of the
components themselves.  These tests are executed frequently, and a large number of them are
used as gatekeepers, trying to ensure that only reliable changes are made to the project.
When a project is released, the scenario coverage is 100% and the code coverage is either
at 100% or whatever percentage the team has negotiated and documented for their project.</p>
<p>Software quality means ensuring that software projects are maintainable.  This entails
sufficient documentation of project goals, architecture, design, and current state. The
documentation is coupled with Static Code Analysis to measure a number of maintainability
metrics and to gatekeep on most of them, ensuring that the project moves in a positive
direction to a higher quality project.</p>
<p>Software quality means ensuring that software projects and their processes are efficient.
Team process to administrate and maintain the software and the software itself do not have to
be blindingly fast, but they need to be as efficient as they need to be for that project and
for that team.  They do not need to be fast as lightning, only fast enough for the software
project itself.</p>
<p>Software quality means ensuring that software projects are secure.  If third party components
are used for the project, those components need to be monitored for vulnerabilities, and
any issues that arise must be addressed quickly.  Steps are taken, at a level that is
appropriate for the type of software project, to reduce the possible ways that an user can use
the software project do something malicious.</p>
<p>To me, software quality is about the journey, continuously improving quality and showing
that progress, while adding new features and fixing bugs at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up<a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-it-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To put it succinctly, software quality for a project is about having a common nomenclature
describing the various pillars of quality, having a common way of measuring against each of
those pillars, and the publishing of those measures.  </p>
<p>Therefore, from my point of view, software quality is not a single metric but a collection of
metrics and a philosophy.  That philosophy is that your team can only really answer that
question by having clearly defined goals for your project and it’s quality metrics, and
steering the project towards those goals.  </p>
<p>Does every project need to be super high quality? No, not even close.  But I firmly believe
that each project needs to have a solid understanding of what level of software quality they
have in order to negotiate the definition of “good enough” for each project.</p>
