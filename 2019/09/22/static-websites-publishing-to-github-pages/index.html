<p>This is the fifth article in a series about setting up my own website using a
Static Site Generator.  For other articles in the series, click on the title of the article

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the previous articles, I used Pelican as my Static Site Generator, generating a nicely
themed site with some test articles in it.  To make sure I can speak with my own voice, I took
my time determining what theming I wanted for the website.  By taking these deliberate steps,
I was able to arrive at my choice for the site’s theme with confidence and clarity.</p>
<p>This entire journey has been geared towards generating an externally hosted website that is
primarily a blog.  This article talks about the final step on that journey: publishing my
website to the free GitHub Pages platform.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-start">Before We Start<a class="headerlink" href="#before-we-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please read <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#operating-system-paths">Operating System Paths</a> from the second article in
this series for my view on operating system pathing. (i.e. /mount/my/path vs. c:\my\path).
To understand the term <strong>base project directory</strong> and the script text <strong>%%%MY_DIRECTORY%%%</strong>,
please read the explanation under
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-2-create-a-project-directory-for-the-site">Step 2: Create a Project Directory For The Site</a>, also from the
second article in this series.</p>
<h2 id="why-github-pages">Why GitHub Pages?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-github-pages" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In looking at a number of sites built on various Static Site Generators (SSGs), it became
obvious that a majority of the pages were hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
With that in mind, I looked into GitHub pages to figure out if it was best solution for me.</p>
<p>The article
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-github-pages">What is GitHub Pages?</a> goes into
a decent amount of detail, but the summary boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s 100% free</li>
<li>only static content can be hosted</li>
<li>don’t do anything illegal</li>
<li>don’t create an excessively large site (over 1 GB in size)</li>
<li>don’t create a site that is incredibly popular (over 100GB per month in bandwidth)</li>
</ul>
<p>For cases where the last two items occur, their website even mentions that they will send
“a polite email from GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support suggesting strategies for
reducing your site’s impact on our servers”.  </p>
<p>To me, this seemed like a good place to start.  I already use Git for source management, so
familiarity with the website and tooling is already there.  Their documentation is good, and
it looks relatively easy to implement.  Another plus.  Most importantly, there are no fees for
upload or serving the content, so I can experiment with various things and not worry about
incurring extra charges.</p>
<h2 id="branches-on-github-pages">Branches on GitHub Pages<a class="headerlink" href="#branches-on-github-pages" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After doing my research on GitHub, specifically about
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages">publishing on GitHub pages</a>,
I was confused about one point.  From my experience with Git, most people and companies do
either repository based development or branch based development.  Even less frequent is
something called monolith based development.  The approach for GitHub pages is not one of
those.</p>
<p>Repository based development uses Git’s distributed nature to create changes on your
own repository, only merging the changes into the “main” repository when you are sure of your
changes.  Branched based development is similar, except the branching feature of Git is used
on a single remote repository, only merging changes into the “main” branch when you are sure
of your changes.  Monolith development is more dangerous, with committing all changes to a
single repository with a single branch.  For all three type of development, there is one
thread going through all of them:  you are keeping versions of a single type of thing in your
repository.</p>
<p>In a number of sites that I researched, it appeared that they were using a tool called
<em>ghp-import</em>.  This tool allows for the content for the site to be stored in the <em>content</em>
branch of the repository, while the produced website is pushed to the <em>master</em> branch of the
same repository.  While I can wrap my mind around it, to me it didn’t seem like a good idea.
As this is outside of my normal workflows, I was pretty sure that at some point I would
forget and push the wrong thing to the wrong branch.  To keep things simple,  I wanted my
website content in one repository, and my website content in another repository.</p>
<p>That itself raised some issues with my current setup, having the <strong>output</strong> directory at the
same level as the <strong>content</strong> directory.  During my research, I came across the statement that
Git repositories cannot contain other repositories.  If you do need to have this kind of
format, a concept called
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">submodules</a> was recommended.  The
plugins and themes repositories for Pelican make heavy use of submodules, so I knew it
could be done. But after some experimentation with some sample repositories, I was unable
to make this work reliably.  Also, while I can learn to wrap my mind around it, it seemed
like a lot of extra work to go through.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided that it was best to keep things simple, keeping 2 repositories that
were 100% separate from each other.   If I do more research and figure out how to make
submodules work reliably, I am confident that I can condense these distinct repositories
into one physical repository.  </p>
<p>With that decision made, I needed to create a new output directory outside of the
<strong>blog-content</strong> directory.  I decided to call this new directory <strong>blog-output</strong> and have
it at the same level as <strong>blog-content</strong>.  To make sure it was initialized properly
with a local repository, I entered the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir ..\blog-ouptut
cd ..\blog-ouptut
git init
</pre></div>
<p>Once that was complete, I had to ensure that the <strong>pelican-*</strong> scripts were changed to point
to the new location, taking a simple search and replace over all of the script files.  That
being completed, I executed each of my <strong>pelican-*</strong> scripts, to verify the changes were
correct, with no problems.  To further ensure things looked good, I performed a
<strong>git status -s</strong> on both repositories to be sure I didn’t miss anything.  While this
approach wasn’t as elegant as the other solution, in my mind it was simpler, and therefore
more maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="adding-remotes-repositories">Adding Remotes Repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-remotes-repositories" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that I had two local repositories, one for content and one for output, it was time to
make remote repositories on GitHub for each of them.  I already had a GitHub account for
some other projects I was looking at, so no worry there.  Even if I didn’t have one set up,
GitHub makes it simple to set up a new account on their <a href="https://github.com">home page</a>.</p>
<p>From there, it was a simple matter of clicking the plus icon at the top right of the main
window, and selecting <em>New Repository</em> from the drop down list.  The first repository I
created was for the content, and I simply called it <strong>blog-content</strong>, which I entered in the
edit box under the <em>Repository Name</em> label.  As I wanted my content to be private, I changed
the selection from <em>Public</em> to <em>Private</em> and clicked on the <em>Create Repository</em> button.</p>
<p>For the other repository, I followed the same instructions with two exceptions.  The first
exception is that, as the output of Pelican needs to be public to be seen, I kept the
selection on <em>Public</em>.  The second exception was the name of the repository.  According to
the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">User Pages</a>
page, to publish any committed pages you need to use a site of the form <em>user-name</em>.github.io
and push any changes to the master branch.  As my user name on GitHub is <em>jackdewinter</em>, this
made my repository name <em>jackdewinter.github.io</em>.</p>
<p>If you are using this article as a guide, please note that you will need to change the
repository name to match your own GitHub user name.</p>
<h2 id="securing-the-github-access">Securing The GitHub Access<a class="headerlink" href="#securing-the-github-access" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first time that I added my remote repositories to their local counterparts, I encountered
a problem almost right away.  When I went to interact with the remotes, I was asked to enter
my user id and password for GitHub each time.  This was more than annoying.  Having faced
this issue before on other systems, I knew there were solutions, so back to the research!</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that my main machine is a Windows machine, so of course this is a bit more
complicated than when I am working on a Linux machine.  If I was on a Linux machine, I would
follow the instructions at
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">Connecting to GitHub with SSH</a>
and things would probably work with no changes.  To start with, I want to make sure that
GitHub has it’s own private/public key pair, so I would follow the instructions under
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">Generating a New SSH Key and adding it to the ssh-agent</a>.
I would then follow the instructions under
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account</a>
to make sure GitHub had the right half of the key.  A couple of Git commands later, and it
would be tested.</p>
<p>In this case, I needed to get it running on windows, and the Win10 instance of SSH takes a bit
more finessing.  To make sure the service was installed and operational, I followed the
instructions on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52113738/starting-ssh-agent-on-windows-10-fails-unable-to-start-ssh-agent-service-erro">Starting the SSH-Agent</a>.  Once that
was performed, I was able to execute <strong>ssh-agent</strong>, and only then could I use <strong>ssh-add</strong>
to add the newly created private key to <strong>ssh-agent</strong>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, I needed to execute these commands to setup the key on my local machine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ssh-agent
ssh-keygen -f %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\blog-publish-key -C "jack.de.winter@outlook.com"
ssh-add %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\blog-publish-key
</pre></div>
<h2 id="attaching-remote-repositories-to-local-repositories">Attaching Remote Repositories to Local Repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#attaching-remote-repositories-to-local-repositories" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This was the real point where I would see if things flowed together properly.  First, I
needed to specify the remote for the <strong>blog-content</strong> repository.  Looking at my GitHub
account, I browsed over to my <strong>blog-content</strong> repository, and clicked on the <em>clone or
download</em> button.  Making sure the link began with <em>ssh</em>, I pressed the clipboard icon
to copy the link into the clipboard.  </p>
<p>Back in my shell, and I change directory to <strong>blog-content</strong> and entered the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add origin %%%PASTE HERE%%%
</pre></div>
<p>where <strong>%%%PASTE HERE%%%</strong> was the text I copied into the clipboard.  As my user id is
<em>jackdewinter</em> and the repository is <strong>blog-content</strong>, the actual text was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git remote add origin https://github.com/jackdewinter/blog-content.git
</pre></div>
<p>This process was then copied for the <strong>blog-output</strong> directory and the
<strong>jackdewinter.github.io</strong> repository.</p>
<h2 id="publish-the-content-to-output">Publish the Content to Output<a class="headerlink" href="#publish-the-content-to-output" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Until this point, when I wanted to look at the website, I would make sure to have the
windows from the <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong> script up and running.  Behind the scenes, the
<strong>pelican-autobuild.bat</strong> script and the <strong>pelican-server.bat</strong> scripts were being run in
their own windows, the first script building the site on any changes and the second script
serving the newly changed content.  As long as I am developing the site or an article,
that workflow is a good and efficient workflow.</p>
<p>When generating the output for the actual website, I felt that I needed a different workflow.
As that act of publishing is a very deliberate act, my feeling is that it should be more
controlled than automatically building the entire site on each change.  Ideally, I want to
be able to proof a group of changes to the website before making those changes public.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for the deliberate workflow is that, from experience, the
generation of anything production grade relies on some form of configuration that is
specific to the thing you are producing.  For my website, this needs extra testing
specifically around that production configuration in order for my confidence in those
changes to be high enough that I am confident in publishing it.</p>
<p>The most immediate example of such configuration is the
<a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/settings.html?highlight=settings#SITEURL">SITE_URL</a>
configuration variable.
While it was not obvious in the examples that I researched, this variable must be set to
the actual base URL of the hosting site.  Using the <em>Elegant</em> theme, if you click on
the <strong>Categories</strong> button in the header, and then the <strong>Home</strong> button, it will stay on
the <strong>Categories</strong> page.  Looking more closely at the source for the <strong>base.html</strong> page,
the <strong>Home</strong> button contains an url is defaulted to <strong>’‘</strong>.  Digging into the template
for the <strong>base.html</strong> page, the value being set for the anchor of that button is
<strong>href=”{{ SITEURL }}”</strong>.</p>
<p>Hence, for the <strong>Home</strong> button to work properly, <strong>SITE_URL</strong> needs a proper value.  The
default configuration in <strong>pythonconf.py</strong> for <strong>SITE_URL</strong> is <strong>’‘</strong>, so that needed to
be changed.  For the developer website to work properly, <strong>SITE_URL</strong> must be set to
<strong>‘http://localhost:8000’</strong> in <strong>pythonconf.py</strong>.  This however introduces a new issue:
how do I make sure this variable is set properly when we publish the output?</p>
<p>Luckily, the Pelican developers thought of situations like this.  Back in the second article
of this series, <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-1a-building-the-web-site-content">Step 4: Create a Generic Web Site</a>,
I mentioned a file called <strong>publishconf.py</strong>.  This file was generated as part of the output
of <strong>pelican-quickstart</strong> and has not been mentioned since.  This file is intended to be used
as part of a publish workflow, allowing the variables from <strong>publishconf.py</strong> to be overridden.</p>
<p>Specifically, in that file, the following code imports the settings from <strong>publishconf.py</strong>
before defining alternate values for them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">abspath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">curdir</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">website.pelicanconf</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">*</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Below this part of the configuration, in the same manner as in <strong>pythonconf.py</strong>, the
<strong>SITEURL</strong> variable in <strong>publishconf.py</strong> is set to <strong>’‘</strong>.  Therefore, when I publish the
website with the publish configuration, it will use <strong>’‘</strong> for the <strong>SITE_URL</strong>.  To make sure
the website publishes properly, I needed to change the <strong>SITE_URL</strong> variable in
<strong>publishconf.py</strong> to reflect the website where we are publishing to, namely
<strong> https://jackdewinter.github.io </strong>.</p>
<p>Now that I took care of that, I just needed to come up with a batch script that makes
use of <strong>publishconf.py</strong>.  To accomplish that, I simply copied the <strong>pelican-build.bat</strong>
script to <strong>pelican-publish.bat</strong>, and edited the file removing the <strong>–debug</strong> flag
and referring to <strong>publishconf.py</strong> instead of <strong>pelicanconf.py</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican --verbose --output ..\blog-output --settings website\publishconf.py website\content
</pre></div>
<p>To test this out, I stopped the <strong>pelican-autobuild.bat</strong> script and executed the
<strong>pelican-publish.bat</strong> script.  By leaving the <strong>pelican-server.bat</strong> script running,
I was able to double check the published links, verifying that they were based on the
<strong>jackdewinter.github.io</strong> site where I wanted to publish them.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-the-content-to-the-remote">Pushing the Content To The Remote<a class="headerlink" href="#pushing-the-content-to-the-remote" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point, I had two local repositories, one with commits and one without, and two remote
repositories with no information.  While I wanted to see the results and work on the
<strong>blog-output</strong> repositories first, it was more important to make sure my work was safe in
the <strong>blog-content</strong> repositories.  So that one would be first.</p>
<p>Changing into the <strong>blog-content</strong> directory and doing a <strong>git status -s</strong>, I noticed a
couple of changes that were not committed.  A quick <strong>git add –all</strong> and a <strong>git commit</strong>
later, all of the changes were committed to the local repository.  At this point, the changes
are present in the local repository, but not in the remote repository.  The following command
will push those changes up to the remote repository’s master branch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push --set-upstream origin master
</pre></div>
<p>At this point, I did a quick check on the <strong>blog-content</strong> repository in GitHub and made
sure that all of the repository was up there.  Now, in the future, I knew I would be more
selective than using <strong>git add –all</strong> most of the time, but for now it was a good start.
So I carefully went through the files that GitHub listed and verified them manually
against what was in the directory.  I didn’t expect any issues, but a quick check helped
with my confidence that I had set up the repository correctly.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-the-output-to-the-remote">Pushing the Output To The Remote<a class="headerlink" href="#pushing-the-output-to-the-remote" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once that was verified, I carefully
repeated the same actions with the <strong>blog-output</strong> directory but with one small change.
In the <strong>blog-content</strong> directory, I want to save any changes.  However, with the
<strong>blog-output</strong> directory, I want to commit everything, ever if there are conflicts.
This is something that is done with quite a few static sites, so the workflow is decently
documented.</p>
<p>As this is an action that I am going to repeat every time I publish, I placed in a script file
called <strong>pelican-upload.bat</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pushd ..\blog-output
git add --all .
git commit -m "new files"
ssh-agent
git push origin master --force

<p>In order: switch to the <strong>blog-output</strong> directory, add all of the files, commit them
with a simple reason, ensure the <em>ssh-agent</em> is up and running, push the committed files
to remote repository, and go back to our original directory.</p>
<p>If that last <strong>git push</strong> looks weird, it is.  It is so weird and destructive that there are
a number of posts like
<a href="https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/git-push---force-and-how-to-deal-with-it">git push –force and how to deal with it</a> and
<a href="https://blog.sensible.io/2012/10/09/git-to-force-put-or-not-to-force-push.html">GIT: To force-push or not to force-push</a>.  However, even after I looked at the
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">manual page for git push</a>, I was still trying to figure
it out.  It wasn’t until I came across
<a href="https://willi.am/blog/2014/08/12/the-dark-side-of-the-force-push/">The Dark Side of the Force Push</a>,
and specifically the <strong>Force Push Pitfalls</strong> section of that article, that things made
sense.</p>

<p>To make sure things looked right, I wanted to do a side by side comparison of what I could
see in my browser both locally and on the new website.  To do that, I opened up one tab
of my browser and pointed it to <strong>http://localhost:8000/</strong>, and another tab beside it and
pointed it to <strong>https://jackdewinter.github.io/</strong>.  To be honest, while I was hoping there
would be no issues, I was expecting at least 1-2 items to be different.  However, as I went
through the comparison, there was 100% parity between the two versions of the website.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this article, I had most of what I needed to start selecting a theme.
It took some small updates to the configuration to make sure I had a good test site available.
This was critical to allowing me to go through each theme I was interested in and see if it
was for what I was looking for.  While one of the themes proved to be a handful, the
experience was good in advising me of possible issues I might have in customizing my own site.</p>
<p>In the end, I had a strong choice of the <em>elegant</em> theme, which as benefits, is actively
being developed and has great documentation.</p>
