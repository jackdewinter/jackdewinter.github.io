<p>This is the third article in a series about setting up my own web site using a
Static Site Generator.  For other articles in the series, click on the title of the article

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With Pelican installed, it was time to start creating stuff.  The first I thing I wanted to do
was to figure out if the base site was good by creating a default site and viewing it in a
browser.  Then I wanted to come up with a very simple test article, publishing it and viewing
it to verify my ability to publish and exercise that workflow.  Finally, I wanted to take
some time to come up with a more representative test article and improve the publishing
workflows.</p>
<p>Similar to the last article, this is not about leaping forward, but to take a decent
step forward in understanding the tools and processes.</p>
<h2 id="before-we-start">Before We Start<a class="headerlink" href="#before-we-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please read <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#operating-system-paths">Operating System Paths</a> from the second article in
this series for my view on operating system pathing. (i.e. /mount/my/path vs. c:\my\path).
To understand the term <strong>base project directory</strong> and the script text <strong>%%%MY_DIRECTORY%%%</strong>,
please read the explanation under
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-2-create-a-project-directory-for-the-site">Step 2: Create a Project Directory For The Site</a>, also from the
second article in this series.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-verify-our-basic-web-site">Step 1: Verify Our Basic Web Site<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-verify-our-basic-web-site" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first thing I wanted to do is to make sure I didn’t mess anything up in the last article,
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/">Setting Up the Pelican Static Site Generator</a>.  Therefore,
it made
the most sense that I verify that my website was up and running before I added my first
article.  After doing some research, it was evident that there are two phases that I need to
take care of: building the content and viewing the content.</p>
<h3 id="step-1a-building-the-web-site-content">Step 1a: Building The Web Site Content<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1a-building-the-web-site-content" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first article’s section on
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/18/static-websites-choosing-a-static-web-site-generator/#what-are-static-site-generators">Static Site Generators (SSGs)</a> hopefully made it clear that
the focus of SSGs is to render the site content when updated.  In the second article,
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-4-create-a-generic-web-site">Setting Up the Pelican Static Site Generator</a>, I created the
base configuration for a generic web site, but did nothing to build that content.
To build that content, I needed to find out how take the empty content and generate
the output files from it.</p>
<p>Looking at some articles, I was drawn to the output of the <strong>pelican-quickstart</strong> command
that generated the base configuration.  In particular, I noticed the prompt:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; Do you want to generate a tasks.py/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) n
</pre></div>
<p>I specifically answered <em>No</em> because of my research.  If you answer <em>Yes</em>, the template will
ask a number of additional questions related to publishing, and it will place the <strong>Makefile</strong>
and <strong>tasks.py</strong> in the <strong>website</strong> directory.  As my primary machine is a Windows machine,
these two files are mostly useless.  Their primary value would be to instruct me on what I
needed to do to replicate their behavior on the command line or in Python.</p>
<p>Thankfully, between the command <strong>pelican –help</strong>, using the <strong>Makefile</strong> for reference,
and experimentation, I was able to arrive that this command for building the web site:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican --debug --output website\output --settings website\pelicanconf.py website\content
</pre></div>
<p>Nothing too fancy.  I started Pelican in debug mode to have more information about what was
going on.  Using the above command, the output was placed in the <strong>website\output</strong>
directory, the settings were retrieved from the <strong>website\pelcianconf.py</strong> file, and the
content for the website is located in the <strong>website\content</strong> directory.  I double checked
to make sure these were all correct, and it ran once without issue.  To make sure that I
didn’t lose this command, I created a simple script <strong>pelican-build.bat</strong> in my base project
directory, with the above command being the only line in that file.</p>
<p>Pelican generated a lot of output, but in the end, it looked like everything was okay.
I was excited to check out the new web site, so I used my web browser to
open the file <strong>website\output\index.html</strong> and got this result:</p>
<p><img alt="initial view" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/static-3/local_html.png" title="Initial Web Page View"/></p>
<p>I must admit… it was kind of underwhelming.  And then I thought about it a bit.  A lot of
the stuff that makes web pages powerful are other parts that included by the web page,
and may not be loaded if the page is loaded directly from the file system.</p>
<p>To properly view the content, I was going to have to host it somewhere.</p>
<h3 id="step-1b-viewing-the-web-site-content">Step 1b: Viewing The Web Site Content<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1b-viewing-the-web-site-content" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are like me, hearing or thinking the words “I need to install my own web server” are not
exactly good words.  Even for a pared down web server, there are usually 3-6 directories to set
up, ports to clear with firewalls, and other little things.  I must admit, when I started
looking around, I was not exactly in a good mood.</p>
<p>However, the first 3 web sites that talked about Pelican were from the Pelican project’s
various versions.  Looking deeper into the documentation, I found the part of the documentation
titled
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/quickstart.html#preview-your-site">Preview Your Site</a>.
Without taking too much away from the documentation, it specified that Python 3 includes a
pared down web server that is available for simple uses, like I needed.</p>
<p>After a bit of experimentation and fiddling, and I came up with the following lines and placed
them in <strong>pelican-server.bat</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pushd website\output
python -m pelican.server
popd
</pre></div>
<p>Executing that script, I then saw the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>XXX\python\python37-32\Lib\runpy.py:125: RuntimeWarning: 'pelican.server' found in sys.modules after import of package 'pelican', but prior to execution of 'pelican.server'; this may result in unpredictable behaviour
  warn(RuntimeWarning(msg))
WARNING: 'python -m pelican.server' is deprecated.
  | The Pelican development server should be run via 'pelican --listen' or 'pelican -l'.
  | This can be combined with regeneration as 'pelican -lr'.
  | Rerun 'pelican-quickstart' to get new Makefile and tasks.py files.
-&gt; Serving at port 8000, server .
...
</pre></div>
<p>While this is what the official documentation suggests, it does look like it is out of date.
Using the output from above, the installed <strong>Makefile</strong> for guidance, and more
experimentation, I replaced the contents of the <strong>pelican-server.bat</strong> file with the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican -l -p 8000 --debug --output website\output --settings website\pelicanconf.py website\content
</pre></div>
<p>This time, the output of the script was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DEBUG: Pelican version: 4.0.1
DEBUG: Python version: 3.7.3
DEBUG: Adding current directory to system path
DEBUG: Temporarily adding PLUGIN_PATHS to system path
DEBUG: Restoring system path
WARNING: Docutils has no localization for 'english'. Using 'en' instead.
-&gt; Serving at port 8000, server .
</pre></div>
<p>To me, it looked like the web pages were served up properly, or at least Pelican didn’t report
any errors to the screen.  The only thing left was to actually see if it would allow me to
load the generated web site to my browser.  Instead of loading the file directly into the web
browser as before, I entered “localhost:8000” in the address bar.   To be honest, I took a
guess that <strong>server .</strong> meant the localhost.</p>
<p>This time, I got the following result:</p>
<p><img alt="local host view" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/static-3/localhost.png" title="Localhost Web Page View"/></p>
<p>Unstyled, no unique content, and only locally visible.  It’s not a great result… but
it’s a start!</p>
<h3 id="step-1c-commit-changes">Step 1c: Commit Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1c-commit-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before I went forward, I wanted to save the current state of the web site, so back to Git and
the <strong>git status -s</strong> command, whose output was now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>?? pelican-build.bat
?? pelican-server.bat
?? website/__pycache__/
?? website/output/
</pre></div>
<p>In my head, I compared these results to the changes I made:</p>
<ul>
<li>I added 2 script files to help me build and serve the content</li>
<li>both file are detected, and I want them as source in my project</li>
<li>I built the web site, placing the output into <strong>website/output</strong></li>
<li>the directory was detected, but I want to generate this output, and not persist it</li>
<li>from previous experience, the <strong>website/<strong>pycache</strong>/</strong> contains
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2998215/if-python-is-interpreted-what-are-pyc-files">pyc files</a> that are built when the python scripts are interpreted</li>
<li>the directory containing these files was detected, but these should never be persisted</li>
</ul>
<p>Using thought processes derived from what I documented in the section
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-5-committing-the-changes">Step 5: Committing the Changes</a> from the previous article,
it was clear that I needed to <strong>git add pelican-build.bat</strong> and <strong>git add pelican-server.bat</strong>
to persist those changes.  However, the two items that I did not want to persist would require
different tacks for each one.  </p>
<p>The first case, <strong>website/output/</strong>, is a directory like the <strong>virtualenv</strong> directory in
the section <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/08/25/static-websites-setting-up-the-pelican-static-site-generator/#step-2-create-a-project-directory-for-the-site"># Step 2: Create a Project Directory For The Site</a>
from the previous article.  Therefore, I edited the <strong>.gitignore</strong> file to include the
directory by name.  That was the simple one.</p>
<p>The second case was more complex, the <strong>website/<strong>pycache</strong>/</strong> directory.  This directory only
exists to contain compiled Python byte code designed to speed up execution on subsequent
passes. If I add the directory, as with the first case, it only takes care of that one
directory.  If I run any Python scripts from other locations, I will have to add those
directories too.  This was not an efficient option, hence I edited the <strong>.gitignore</strong> file to
ignore the files themselves, by specifying <strong>&amp;ast.pyc</strong> as the pattern to ignore.</p>
<p>Therefore, following those changes, the <strong>.gitignore</strong> file looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>virtualenv/
website/output/
*.pyc
</pre></div>
<p>Using <strong>git status -s</strong>, I verified that only the 2 scripts were being added, as well as the
<strong>.gitignore</strong> file itself being changed.  Quickly adding <strong>git add .gitignore</strong>, I then
used <strong>git commit -m “my message”</strong> to commit these changes to the repository.</p>
<p>So let’s take inventory.  We have a basic web site up and running, we have tested it in
our browser, and we have committed any changes to our local repository.  It’s definitely time
to write our first article.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-the-first-article">Step 2: The First Article<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-the-first-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking through the Pelican Documentation, I found another good section on
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.0.1/content.html#writing-content">Writing Content</a>.
From here, I learned that certain Markdown processors, such as the Python implementation,
support metadata on files.</p>
<p>As a base example, they specify this as a sample post:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">Title</span>: <span class="nv">My</span> <span class="nv">super</span> <span class="nv">title</span>
<span class="nv">Date</span>: <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">03</span> <span class="mi">10</span>:<span class="mi">20</span>
<span class="nv">Modified</span>: <span class="mi">2010</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">05</span> <span class="mi">19</span>:<span class="mi">30</span>
<span class="nv">Category</span>: <span class="nv">Python</span>
<span class="nv">Tags</span>: <span class="nv">pelican</span>, <span class="nv">publishing</span>
<span class="nv">Slug</span>: <span class="nv">my</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">super</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">post</span>

<span class="nv">Summary</span>: <span class="nv">Short</span> <span class="nv">version</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">index</span> <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">feeds</span>

<span class="nv">This</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">content</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">my</span> <span class="nv">super</span> <span class="nv">blog</span> <span class="nv">post</span>.
</pre></div>
<p>Reading further, a lot of the metadata fields have defaults, but the <strong>Title</strong> metadata
is required for the page to be picked up and processed by Pelican.  That got some wheels
turning in my head, but I put it aside for a later article.  First I wanted to have a
solid way of writing the articles before adding to that.</p>
<p>Taking the markdown content from above, I created a file in the <strong>website/content</strong> directory
called <strong>test.md</strong> and placed the content in there and saved it.  Following the same pattern
I used for the base content, I ran <strong>pelican-build.bat</strong> and then <strong>pelican-server.bat</strong> to
view the content, providing the following:</p>
<p><img alt="first article view" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/static-3/step-2-a-main.png" title="Bla blah"/></p>
<p>Granted, its a stock article, but I now have a way to publish my articles!  However, along the
way, I noticed a couple of things I want to improve on.</p>
<h3 id="step-3a-a-more-streamlined-buildpreview-workflow">Step 3a: A More Streamlined Build/Preview Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3a-a-more-streamlined-buildpreview-workflow" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the previous section, the workflow I used took 4 actions to go from something I wrote to
something I could see and validate: save the file, run <strong>pelican-build.bat</strong>, run
<strong>pelican-server.bat</strong>, and refresh the web page.  Wondering if there was a more efficient
way to do that, I checked back on the <strong>Makefile</strong> that I used as the inspiration
for the two scripts, and noticed a <strong>devserver</strong> entry.</p>
<p>As the <strong>devserver</strong> entry only differed from the <strong>server</strong> entry by the introduction of
the <strong>-r</strong> flag, I quickly created a <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong> with that simple change,
and executed it.  Within seconds, I got the feedback:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CRITICAL: TypeError: can't pickle generator objects
</pre></div>
<p>Weird error, but understandable.  In Python, the default serialization of objects to be passed
outside of executables is referred to as
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html">pickling</a>.  If Pelican was already hosting
the server and wanted to spawn a process to rebuild the web site, it would make sense that it
pass the current configuration to that new process.</p>
<p>Doing a bit more searching, I came across
<a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/2400">this issue</a> logged against the Pelican
project in GitHub.   There are a fair number of entries for this issue, offering various
pieces of advice.  The low down for me is that due to the way pickling works, I cannot use it
on my Windows machine with that given program.  Reading further in the comments for the issue,
a number of people did mention that the <strong>-r</strong> flag works fine when applied to the command I
am using for building the pages, just not for building the pages from the server.</p>
<p>Trying it out, I renamed <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong> to <strong>pelican-autobuild.bat</strong>, and switched
the file contents to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pelican -r --output website\output --settings website\pelicanconf.py website\content
</pre></div>
<p>Based on what I read, this should have my desired effect, and a quick modification of the
<strong>test.md</strong> file confirmed it.  When I saved the file, the generator detected it and
rebuilt the contents.  However, thinking through things a bit more, I wondered if the
<a href="https://ss64.com/nt/start.html">Windows start</a> command would help build a better solution.</p>
<p>When I write a Windows batch file and I need to execute another batch file, I use the
<strong>call</strong> primitive.  This allows me to run the new batch file within the current batch file’s
shell.  When that new batch file completes, I can check the return code from that script, and
determine what action, if any, to do next.  By structuring batch files and scripts this way,
I find that I assemble things together more quickly, keeping the batch files and scripts
more readable and more maintainable.</p>
<p>The <strong>start</strong> primitive is almost identical to the <strong>call</strong> primitive, with one small
exception: the new program is started in a newly created shell spawned from the current shell.
As the current shell and the new shell are separate processes, by default, both shells operate
independently of each other, unless the <strong>/wait</strong> flag is specified.  While this is not ideal
for composing batch files, this behavior seemed to fit what I was trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Creating a new version of the <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong> file, I placed within it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@echo off
start pelican-autobuild.bat
start pelican-server.bat
</pre></div>
<p>And executed the batch file.  Two full size shell windows popped up, each one running one
of the scripts, with the original shell window left alone.  A new modification to the
<strong>test.md</strong> file resulted in the rebuild happening in the window running
<strong>pelican-autobuild.bat</strong>.  A quick refresh of the browser page, and the newly changed article
appeared in the browser.</p>
<p>I was mostly where I needed the script to be.  Further tweaking the contents of <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong> to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>@echo off
start "Builder-Pelican" /min pelican-autobuild.bat
start "Server-Pelican" /min pelican-server.bat
</pre></div>
<p>got me to where I wanted to be. To keep things clean, I wanted to specify a title for each
shell window and I wanted to start them minimized.  Thus, by default both windows are out of
the way, but if I need them, I can find them quickly.</p>
<p>Side Note: If you are using this as a guide, note that this only seems to be an issue on
Windows machines.  In quick tests I did using an Ubuntu image running under Docker, I did
not see this issue, and the served pages updated properly.</p>
<h3 id="step-3b-a-more-representative-test-article">Step 3b: A More Representative Test Article<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3b-a-more-representative-test-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed about my test article is that it was short.  Really short.  When
I posted it, it was hard to notice where the test article was being summarized, and where
it was just the article.  I needed to come up with a test article that would be a better
representation of an actual article.  For that, I dug back into my testing experience.</p>
<p>When coming up with test information for test projects, I have used the site
<a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a> and sites like it for years. The site goes into more
details, but by using this text it allows someone viewing the text to focus on what is around
the text instead of the text itself.  This is also better than using random words, as someone
viewing that random text may try and find patterns in the paragraphs, once again distracting
from what is around the text.</p>
<p>After a couple of quick clicks on the site, and it generated 5 decent sized paragraphs of
random text that started with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc eget velit porta, efficitur justo at, sagittis nulla. Donec neque arcu, condimentum sed massa a, elementum rhoncus justo.
...
</pre></div>
<p>I didn’t include all 5 paragraphs here, as it was randomly generated.  If you are using
this as a guide, you can easily generate your own test paragraphs and insert them into
your test message.  However, when the page was regenerated, this is what it looked like:</p>
<p><img alt="first article view" src="https://jackdewinter.github.io/images/static-3/test-lorem-ipsum.png" title="Bla blah"/></p>
<p>Also, to give a bit of contrast, I created a copy of the page, called it <strong>test-2.md</strong>,
changed the title a bit, and removed all except the first two paragraphs.  My reasoning
behind this was to make sure I had a sample that was long and a sample that was short.</p>
<h3 id="step-3c-commit-the-changes">Step 3c: Commit The Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3c-commit-the-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As always, before moving on, I needed to make sure I committed the changes.  This one
was easy, simply performing the <strong>git add</strong> action on the files <strong>test.md</strong>,
<strong>pelican-autobuild.bat</strong>, and <strong>pelican-devserver.bat</strong>, followed by a <strong>git commit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-accomplished">What Was Accomplished<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-accomplished" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of this article, I only had the foundation for a basic web site.  The first
thing I did was to make sure I had a good workflow for generating the web site and viewing
it in a browser as a web site.  After that, I added a sample article, and also improved the
original build/preview workflow.  Finally, I created more realistic data for the test
article, so I could see what a normal article would look like.</p>
<p>As for the goal of creating a test article that I could use to start fine-tuning the site,
I believe I am in a good place.  So next, fine-tuning and selecting a theme!</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next, I need to clean up a couple of small things before selecting a theme for the website.
Getting a solid choice for a theme is the last major task I have to complete before
publishing the web site itself.  Completing this last major task will be covered in the next
post <a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/09/08/static-websites-getting-ready-for-publishing-themes-and-minutiae/">Getting Ready For Publishing - Themes and Minutiae</a>.</p>
