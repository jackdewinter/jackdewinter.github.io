<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="{filename}/articles/SoftwareQuality/beta-bugs-b.md">last article</a>, I talked
about the headway I am making towards getting more pending issues dealt with.
In this article, I talk about my efforts to clean up the scenario tests and
the existing parser issues.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another week of demanding work, and another week of results to show for it.  While
the results of this week are not as flashy and the results from previous weeks,
they are still all very meaningful and useful.  After a couple of weeks focusing
on the newer issues, I decided to tackle some of the older issues.  Or
at the very least, issues that have been around for a while.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/c265b2328298ca134e31b3fc14dd448e4c4ab37a">06 Oct 2021</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/debc82ac05bf2c8db689fd9b4f8bf69352d5ec6a">10 Oct 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="issue-44-the-task-that-keeps-on-giving"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/44">Issue 44</a> - The Task That Keeps on Giving<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-44-the-task-that-keeps-on-giving" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To say that completing Issue 44 is a huge task is not doing it justice.  At nine hours and counting,
I have verified that all non-rule scenario tests have either descriptive or derivative
documentation at the top of their test function.  With over 3300 scenario tests as of this
afternoon, it is no easy feat to go through and verify the comment string starting each
test.  It is incredibly boring and monotonous.  And I do not know about any readers,
but for me, those are the tasks where I get into a mindless kind of action that easily
leads itself to mistakes.  Did I mention monotonous?  Huge? Boring?</p>
<p>So why do it?  Because I believe it is the right thing to do.  During the months of
work on this project, I tried to keep every comment string current.  When all is said
and done, that is the easiest way to ensure the documentation is up to date.  But the truth is
that I did not always keep those strings current.  If I were in a hurry, I would often
copy a scenario test, change it to suit the current circumstances, and then go on to
the next scenario test.  The function name of the test was changed, but not the description.
It was because of that “speedy” behavior that I now found myself scouring over 3300 scenario
tests for proper comment strings.</p>
<p>After nine hours of grueling work, I now have all scenario tests covered except for the ones
that deal with the rules.  There is not much to talk about regarding the fixing of documentation
strings.  In each case, I determine if the scenario test is an original test or a derivative
of a nearby test.  If it is an original test, I create a descriptive comment string to
try and capture what the test is trying to achieve.  In the other cases, I use a
derivative comment string, usually stating with <code>variation of</code>, that notes the test that
it is a derivative of and what change is being made for that specific test.</p>
<p>To be honest, while this task is monotonous, extremely monotonous, it is mostly
reading the comment strings to make sure they make sense.  When there are obvious
copy-and-forget-to-change strings, they are typically easy to spot and come in groups
of three or more.  There really is no other way to describe it than it being a boring
task.  But the benefit is in having a coherent set of scenario tests with confidence
that their comment strings describe what the test is about.  And that decreases the
cost of maintaining the project.</p>
<p>It is a pain, but it is worth it.  I think so at least.  But let me revisit that
statement once I have finished verifying every scenario test.  As a friend said
one time:</p>

<p>Your Mileage May Very.  Objects in the rear-view mirror may be closer than they appear.</p>

<h2 id="issue-28-pre-commit-hooks"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/28">Issue 28</a> - Pre-Commit Hooks<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-28-pre-commit-hooks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It probably skipped everyone’s notice, but a change was introduced
during the last month to add Git pre-commit support to the project.  The
change itself was a ridiculously small one: adding the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml">.pre-commit-hooks.yaml</a>
file to the project by one of our contributors.  But the effect was huge. The PyMarkdown
project can now be used as a pre-commit hook on any system that supports Git Pre-Commit
hooks.</p>
<p>By including that file in the repository, Git projects on GitHub can now
leverage that information to execute the PyMarkdown project without having to
install a Python package.  While the file itself does not contain much
information, it allows for a <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> file to be added to any
repository that references PyMarkdown.  If that file is present and contains a
reference to the PyMarkdown repository
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/pre-commit.md">as documented here</a>,
then PyMarkdown will be invoked as configured.  It is neat and tidy.  Even better,
it is an almost zero-cost approach for using PyMarkdown.</p>
<p>But as with any project, there were a couple of baby steps that needed to be taken.</p>
<h3 id="problem-1-allowing-for-configuration">Problem 1: Allowing for Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-1-allowing-for-configuration" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first issue with this feature was easy to overcome: how to allow for
configuration?  Because of the way the <code>.pre-commit-hooks.yaml</code> file is organized,
my first instinct was to specify an <code>entry</code> value of <code>pymarkdown scan</code>.  While this
worked as a great default, when custom arguments were added, they were appended
to the end of that value.  Therefore, if you wanted to disable rule <code>not-me</code> and tried
to add an <code>args</code> value of <code>["--disable-rules", "not-me"]</code>, the executed command
line would be <code>pymarkdown scan --disable-rules not-me</code>.  Adding the <code>scan</code> keyword
to the end would not work either, as that keyword had already appeared.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, the solution to this was to use a good default
and to add easy-to-read documentation on how to deal with the rest.  Having the
default composed string of <code>pymarkdown scan</code> was the correct choice, I just chose
a bad implementation of how to get there.  By splitting those two keywords into
an <code>entry</code> value of <code>pymarkdown</code> and an <code>args</code> value of <code>scan</code> provided the
required flexibility to add user-defined configuration.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>To deal with the rest of the issue,
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/pre-commit.md#arguments">documentation was added</a>
to inform the user that
if they add scanning configuration, the final <code>args</code> argument should be <code>scan</code>.
While there is nothing preventing users from using any of the other modes of
the project, those modes tend to be mostly static.  Therefore, I determined that
invoking those modes have near-zero use for invoking PyMarkdown through a
pre-commit hook and geared the pre-commit documentation solely towards
the <code>scan</code> mode usage.</p>
<h3 id="problem-2-what-is-good-documentation">Problem 2: What Is Good Documentation?<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-2-what-is-good-documentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While addressing the simple stuff for pre-commit hooks was easy, there was an
interesting question posed by one of the contributors.  The
condensed version of that question was: why provide any pre-commit documentation
at all?  The points that they raised were valid.  The target implementation
of pre-commit used by GitHub may change, requiring a change to the documentation.
So would not a “for any questions, go to pre-commit’s site” be sufficient.</p>
<p>Thinking about the issue like someone who had just found out about pre-commit
hooks<sup id="fnref:rediscover"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rediscover">1</a></sup>, I added documentation while trying to maintain that viewpoint.
My goal was
to add enough documentation that a relative pre-commit newbie like myself could
add PyMarkdown support to their project using that documentation.  While the amount
of text in that document was not large, it was not small either.  But for me, it
was the right amount of documentation for the subject at hand.</p>
<p>Even so, I spent the next couple of weeks after that comment wondering whether
I had gone overboard or not.  It was not an easy decision or a hard decision,
I just was not sure how I should evaluate it.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided I had to set a clear goal for the feature and for the
documentation.  To me, the goal of the feature was
to make it easy to add PyMarkdown support into a Git project.  Once I
nailed that down, the documentation focus became a lot clearer.  If I
wanted to make adding pre-commit support easy, I needed good support to walk
people through 90% of the things they can do with PyMarkdown and their
pre-commit hooks.</p>
<p>With that focus, I felt that the scope of the document
was validated.  As I had written the document as a relative pre-commit
newbie, I felt that the information presented answered all normal
questions that I had during that process.  How do I add it? Where
do I add it? Can I lock it down to a version so I can replicate a
set of results? How do I configure it?  Can I use a local configuration
file?  Can I control which files it scans?  These were all questions
that I asked myself when I added PyMarkdown support to one of my
private repositories.</p>
<p>While the document is long, I strongly feel that it answers each
of the questions in the previous paragraph properly.  And from my viewpoint,
if my goal is to make it easy to add PyMarkdown support through git pre-commit
hooks, then that is the level of documentation required. Time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="release-091">Release 0.9.1<a class="headerlink" href="#release-091" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully release events will be happening more frequently for this project,
and this was a good one.  With a good collection of additions and fixes, it
just felt like a suitable time to release an update.</p>
<h2 id="issue-47-fun-with-fenced-code-blocks"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/47">Issue 47</a> - Fun with Fenced Code Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-47-fun-with-fenced-code-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Okay, maybe fun is not the right word.  Going back over the results of
the latest test scan, I noticed that I still had around eleven scenario
tests that were marked as <code>skipped</code>.  Deciding to tackle them to wrap up
the week, I first started looking at the three scenario tests that were
part of the Fenced Code Block tests.</p>
<p>The parsing errors were simple to see.  In two of the tests, a
start Fenced Code Block token was present without a matching end
Fenced Code Block token.  The remaining test mistakenly reports the
Fenced Code Block element as a HTML Block element, totally missing the
mark.  It just looked bad.</p>
<p>The good news?  Well… the relatively good news?  All three scenario tests
dealt with Link Reference Definitions that are aborted part way through. As
I have mentioned in previous articles, the proper handling of Link Reference
Definition elements are not easy, and those elements remain as the one aspect
of the parser that does not have my full confidence.  That lack of confidence
is not for lack of trying.  It is a measure of the many combinations of aborted
Link Reference Definitions and the other elements that surround them there are.
I know I am getting closer to having them
all covered, but I am not sure that I have every combination covered… yet!
This was just continuing the process of increasing coverage on Link
Reference Definitions, and I was ready to accept that challenge.</p>
<h3 id="covering-this-combination">Covering This Combination<a class="headerlink" href="#covering-this-combination" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In each of these three scenarios, a Fenced Code Block element was started inside
of a container element.  In all three scenarios, the next line includes a
valid open for a Link Reference Definition element, only to have the container
close on the third line.  From a parser point of view, the Link Reference
Definition element was only in a partial state and therefore needs to be
rewound to be interpreted as normal text.  It was in that code that the
issue appeared.</p>
<p>In all three scenarios, the currently active token stack (<code>token_stack</code>)
and the current token document (<code>token_document</code>) maintained in the
<code>parser_state</code> variable were not being rewound properly.  The result
was that both the <code>token_stack</code> and <code>token_document</code> variables were left
in weird states.  It was then that I recognized that the second line of
the Link Reference Definition was valid, and I needed to adjust the
tokens to match a partially finished Link Reference Definition.</p>
<p>In these specific cases, the second line of the Link Reference Definition
was properly following the first line, providing a Link Reference Definition
element that has a label and an URL, but no title.  By reducing the
number of examined lines to only include those two lines, the code was
able to form a complete reference with only the label and the URL.
After having done that, the work that went into that was being
erased.  But why?</p>
<p>Looking some more at the code, the answer slowly became obvious.  As the code
for the <code>process_link_reference_definition</code> function existed at that time,
if a requeue was requested, the code assumed that no valid Link Reference
Definition was parsed.  However, in these three scenarios, a partial Link Reference
Definition was found and there was at least one line to requeue for
processing.</p>
<p>The fix was simple: do not rewind everything if a partial reference is
parsed.  Even a partial reference is valid and that means that the
text from the start of the element remains valid.  Looking in the (seriously
in need of a refactor) function <code>process_link_reference_definition</code>, there is
a block of code near line 188:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">lrd_stack_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy_of_last_block_quote_markdown_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and another block near line 228:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">lines_to_requeue</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To fix these scenarios, I grabbed the lines between those two sections
and placed them under the following conditional:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">did_complete_lrd</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Even though there may be lines that need to be requeued, if there
is even a partial Link Reference Definition, the document stack and the
document token are not rewound.</p>
<p>It took a while to figure that out, but when I added that code, things
started to fall into place.  I went through the three scenario tests and
started to adjust the tokens and to verify the output against
<a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2">Babelmark</a>.
And things just worked.  It was a good feeling.</p>
<h2 id="issue-49-html-blocks"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/49">Issue 49</a> - HTML Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-49-html-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Following up from the previous work I did on Fenced Code Blocks, I thought
that dealing with the six scenario tests dealing with HTML blocks was a good
option for my next task.  That, and
while I had confidence I could deal with the skipped List element scenario
tests, I wanted to leave them to last.  I know that container elements are
tricky and can easily devolve into a time sink.  So, HTML Block elements it
was!</p>
<h3 id="html-blocks-are-like-code-blocks">HTML Blocks Are Like Code Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#html-blocks-are-like-code-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting at the end of the skipped HTML Block tests, I worked my way back
up the list.  It was quickly obvious that the problem with each of the
first four tests was a simple one.  In each case, the Container Block
processor was looking for a valid Link Reference Definition within a
HTML Block element.  It was as simple as that.</p>
<p>If that does not make sense, there are two lines in the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#html-blocks">GitHub Flavored Markdown specification</a>
that should make this clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML blocks continue until they are closed by their appropriate end
condition, or the last line of the document or other container block.
This means any HTML within an HTML block that might otherwise be
recognized as a start condition will be ignored by the parser and passed
through as-is, without changing the parser’s state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While a bit terse, the meaning of those two sentences is clear.  Once a
HTML Block element is started, any HTML is passed through as-is.  To be
even more precise, everything within the block is considered HTML, even if it is
not valid HTML.  Therefore, if something that looks like a Link
Reference Definition is started, it should be treated like HTML and
passed through as-is.</p>
<p>To address that problem, I modified the call to <code>__handle_link_reference_definition</code>
in the function <code>__parse_line_for_leaf_blocks</code> from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This code ignores any Link Reference Definition starts if
the flag is passed to the function or if the current stack token is
an HTML Block token.</p>
<p>Going through the last four scenario tests, I was able to make quick work of
getting each of the tests cleaned up and passing.  In each scenario, it was
just matter of validating the tokens by hand, then using Babelmark to verify
the HTML.  That process went quickly.</p>
<p>To ensure that things were kept in a good state, I decided to commit these
changes, having a good solid bookmark for later.   It turns out that it was
a clever idea that would pay dividends soon.  Things were about to get messy.</p>
<h3 id="link-reference-definitions-and-line-requeues">Link Reference Definitions and Line Requeues<a class="headerlink" href="#link-reference-definitions-and-line-requeues" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I can clearly remember looking at the Markdown for scenario test
<code>test_html_blocks_extra_02a</code>, then looking at the generated HTML and thinking
“that looks wrong”.  It took me about twenty minutes of looking
and work around the house to figure out why, but I got there.<sup id="fnref:break"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:break">2</a></sup></p>
<p>To understand the reason that the generated HTML looked wrong
requires history on the PyMarkdown project.  I started working on the
PyMarkdown project because I saw a need for a Markdown linter that was
written in Python.  Now, I have a long love of parsers based on solid
specifications because there is a finality to them that is appealing to me.
People can argue about whether this one piece of Markdown is prettier or more
functional than another piece of Markdown.  That is opinion.  But I decided to
start writing the parser against the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown specification</a>,
following that wherever it took me.  It was a solid specification with examples,
so it provided guidance what was valid and test data that backed up that
guidance. For most of the project, I easily implemented the new elements,
one after the other.</p>
<p>The last element of the specification core that I implemented were Link
Reference Definition elements.  From looking at the specification for the
element, I knew there was a simple way to do it and a proper way to do it.
Knowing that the difference between the two approaches was at least one month
of development time, I followed my gut and decided to do it the proper way.
Regardless of what happens, I solidly feel that I made the right decision at
that point.</p>
<p>And the fallout from that decision was not easy to swallow.  The resultant
effort added at least two months of work required to support Link Reference Definitions
and line requeues.  Parsing the Link Reference Definitions going forward
was the easy part.  Because of the nature of Link Reference Definitions,
it is not unusual for the next line to be read in before determining if an
active Link Reference Definition is complete.  If that next line completes
the Link Reference Definition, everything is good.  Otherwise, the data
needs to be rewound, resulting in any lines used to be requeued.  To
keep things simple, I always use the <code>requeue_line_info</code> variable to denote
requeued lines of this nature.</p>
<p>Those line requeues also must reverse any state changes, which is where
the problems usually arise.  In a smaller, more contained system, it would
be easier to record any changes and simply roll them back when the lines
are requeued.  That is a more challenging task to achieve in this project.
I am confident that I have at least 85% to 90% of the cases dealt
with, but that is just a guess.  And with only a small handful of failures
in the base specification’s test data, I have had to generate my own test
data to test these scenarios properly.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean-for-these-tests">What Does This Mean for These Tests?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-this-mean-for-these-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With that history refresher completed, I can now point out that PyMarkdown
is one of the few parsers that I have examined that properly implement Link
Reference Definitions. After talking with a handful of parser authors and checking
their source code,
the most prevalent way of parsing Link Reference Definitions is to examine
parsed Paragraph elements looking for Link Reference Definitions within
their content.  While it is not a perfect match for the functionality, that
approach surprisingly handles most of the cases that come up.  The only
difference is that the use of Paragraphs as a “container” also allows for
Paragraph Continuation to happen.</p>
<p>It was as I was looking at the <code>test_html_blocks_extra_02a</code> test when all
this information came flooding back to me.  The resultant HTML looked wrong
because it was wrong.  If you are using the “parse from paragraph” approach,
then the Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>producing a Link Reference Definition token makes sense.  Line two starts the
Link Reference Definition, only to be continued and completed on line three
because line three becomes
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#paragraph-continuation-text">paragraph continuation text</a>,
allowing it to be added to the previous line due to
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#lazy-continuation-line">laziness</a>.  This results in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/li&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">li</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>However, I decided to approach Link Reference Definitions as their own leaf
element.  This meant adjusting the output of the scenario tests to
reflect that approach.  In particular, the above example produces the following
HTML output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/li&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">li</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">:</span>
<span class="err">/url</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">li</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">ul</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Without the paragraph continuation promoting laziness, the Link Reference
Definition is not valid, resulting in it being interpreted as plain text.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing The Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-the-problem" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Digging into this problem, I noticed a few issues that I needed to solve.
The first issue was in the <code>__check_for_list_closures</code> function where an
already started Link Reference Definition stopped a list from being properly
closed.  In the previous Markdown example, this is what prevented the parser
from properly terminating the Link Reference Definition when the indentation
did not support continuing the list on line three.</p>
<p>But removing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">was_link_definition_started</span>
</pre></div>
<p>caused a cascade effect. Once removed, the <code>close_open_blocks_fn</code> function was
able to try and close the open list element.  The problem that it uncovered is
that there was not any support for the <code>requeue_line_info</code> variable.
It took the better part of two hours to add proper support for the
<code>requeue_line_info</code> variable, including support for the cases where that
variable was not used.  And even after adding that code and getting all
the other tests passing, I still walked through the scenarios with the debugger
to make sure things were working properly.</p>
<p>As I switched my focus back to solving the issue for the tests, the
next issue that arose was that an extra blank line was getting inserted
during the rewind.  After figuring out that it was the “empty”
arguments used to terminate the Link Reference Definition in the
<code>close_open_blocks_fn</code> function, I explored whether to pass extra
data into that function to be used for aborted Link Reference Definitions.
Since this was the only case where it happened, I opted instead to keep
the modifications local, adding in two asserts and replacing that
blank line with the current line in the <code>__check_for_list_closures</code> function
itself.  I am not sure if I am 100% okay with this solution, because it
feels like more of a hack that a proper fix.  But given the amount of
extra work that would need to be done to support a new parameter in the
<code>close_open_blocks_fn</code> function, it was a lower cost option that was
clean to implement.</p>
<p>Thinking I was done, I reran the tests, expecting them to pass.  They
did not pass.  Going once again into the debugger, I found that I was
not properly managing the cases where the stack depth decreased.
Specifically, there were cases where the start of the Link Reference
Definition removed an existing element when it was parsed.  As that
line was now being unwound, those <code>token_stack</code> elements needed to
be put back to how they were before.</p>
<p>Once again trying to think out of the box, I worked on clever tricks
to make things work before deciding on using something simple: a
stack copy.  I had avoided using these in the past as I was afraid
that they would not capture the state properly.  But in this case,
there was no alternative.  Going back to the
<code>process_link_reference_definition</code> function, I transformed this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">original_stack_depth</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">original_stack_depth</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>into:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">original_stack_depth</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>

</pre></div>
<p>With that last change added, the final two scenario tests were now passing.
Executing every scenario test for the project, I found and handful of other
scenario tests that were also “wrong” and fixed them.  It was a good find,
and I was happy to increase my confidence in how aborted Link Reference
Definitions were handled.</p>
<p>But next… the three disabled List element scenario tests.  But they
could wait until Sunday morning.</p>
<h2 id="issue-51-lists-and-indents"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/51">Issue 51</a> - Lists and Indents<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-51-lists-and-indents" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After spending my free time on Saturday working on Issue 49, I could
only hope that Issue 51 would be a lot easier.  But knowing that those
scenario tests were dealing with List elements did not give me
confidence.  It is not that I cannot find issues with Lists, it is quite the
opposite.  Whether it is true or not, I think I have worked hard to deal with
most of the List element related failures.  That means that whatever failures
are left and more difficult.  Not fun… but still worth doing.</p>
<p>Taking a quick look at the three scenario tests, the Markdown documents quickly
divided the tests into two groups.  The first group dealt with strange indents
and Block Quote elements while the second group dealt with interesting indentation
and its effect on the output.   After flipping a card that I keep on my desk for
just these decisions, I decided to work on the second group first.</p>
<p>Looking at the failures, it was obvious that there were two separate
problems.  The first problem was that valid list starts that started with more
than three space characters were being ignored.  In particular, the entries
for nested lists that were indented more than three spaces from the start were
not parsing properly. To solve this issue, I created a new
<code>__adjust_whitespace_for_nested_lists</code> function that examined a current list
token and its parent token, finding the correct range for a “base”
ident to use.  Once that range was determined, if the amount of whitespace
was within that range, the <code>adj_ws</code> variable was trimmed to remove excess
space characters.</p>
<p>Continuing with that theme, the next issue was within the <code>__process_eligible_list_start</code>
function.  Like the work performed in the <code>__adjust_whitespace_for_nested_lists</code>
function, the <code>__process_eligible_list_start</code> needed to be adjusted to
only remove stack items that were necessary to remove.  Like the case for
the previous solution, this solution was geared towards properly taking
care of lists and their indentation.  In this case, it needed to
deal with list indents that were decreasing for a given list level but
were still considered valid.</p>
<p>A good example of this is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
     <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
    <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
   <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In each list item for the nested list, the lists are indented properly, just
aligned on the right side.  In that document, it means the starting point for
the text remains constant, but the starting point for the list text decreases
by one for each line.</p>
<p>To solve this, I needed to add another range check.  While increasing indents
for lists had already been dealt with, I needed to support decreasing indents.
As such, the left bound for that range was the start of text for the parent
list.  The right bound was that point plus three characters, as dictated by
the specification.  It took a bit to code, but it was quickly added to the
function.</p>
<p>Hoping I had done enough to solve the issue, I executed the scenario tests and
verified the results.  After correcting the tokens and verifying the output,
I was happy to have both List element tests now passing.  It was a good feeling.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-first-group">What About the First Group?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-about-the-first-group" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After all that work, it was already later in the afternoon that I had hoped
for.  As such, I created a new issue for the remaining test and started to
compose the article as I went through the process of committing the changes
so far.  The work was a big enough chunk as it was that I did not feel bad
in separating the work.  It just made sense.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ugh.  It was a long week and a boring week.  But I know that work is going
to pay off in lower maintenance costs going forward, so I am still on-board
for getting it done.  It just needs to get done, and I must muster the
patience to get it accomplished in short order.</p>
<p>As for the other work that I accomplished this week, I am happy to get those
items off the Issues List.  The painful thing that I realized after solving
those issues is that I could have solved them earlier.  Granted it took the
better part of two days to eliminate ten of eleven skipped tests, but that is
a small amount of effort to expend.  I feel that I could have
expended that effort earlier and expended less effort to solve them.</p>
<p>But things worked out the way they did, and the project is better for it.
At this point, I am just focusing ahead at getting the reported issues
dealt with and making the project as robust as possible.  I do feel it is
in a good place, I just want it to be in a slightly better place!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I still need to finish the verification of the comment strings.  I do not
want to let that drag on.  But as to which issues I will choose other than
that one, I am not sure.  Stay tuned!</p>
