you will notice a 9 day gap.  While some of time in that gap was spent trying to figure out the
right wording for the documentation on the rules, a lot of it wasn’t.  That is what I want to talk about in
this section: open source software projects and your life.</p>
<p>I love my PyMarkdown project, I really do, but it is not my life.  In the
grand scheme of things, it is important, but not more important than things
in my life like my health, my family, my job, and my sanity.  Even though I
was feeling better after the previous weekend, I was not at 100%.  To be
honest, for that week, if I was at 60% it was a great day.  And while some
people might disagree with me, my priorities that week were on anything
except the PyMarkdown project.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t a difficult decision to make either.  After working at my
day job and doing what I could around the house, I had little energy left
to do anything else.  When I could, I did work on the project, but when
my energy ran out, I locked my computer and went somewhere to depressurize
and rest.</p>
<p>I didn’t think twice about this either.  The reason I can spend evenings and
weekends working on this project is my job.  The reason that I have the
mental energy to work on this project is due to my health.  The reason that
I have the emotional energy to work on this project is due to my family
and my sanity.  Unless I want to develop negative feelings about this
project, I need to ensure that [more]</p>

<p>Taking my time with this task, per
<a href="xxx">section X above</a>,
I worked through this task at a leisurely pace.  While I did a couple of
format changes and section title changes, the relative content of the
sections was already fixed in my mind when I started.  It just took
a bit of experimentation to figure out what the correct layout was.</p>
<p>In my mind, this task was all about taking the information that was in
my head about each rule and documenting it in such a manner that a
user running into a violation of the rule would find useful.  Starting
with
<a href="docs/rule_md001.md">Rule md001</a>,
this meant that I needed to have any aliases for the rule at the top,
followed by a one line summary of the rules.  Next was a paragraph
explaining the reason that the rule was needed, followed by good examples
of what the rule triggered on and what the rule does not trigger on.
Rounding out that group of information was simple information on any
configuration that applied to the rule.  Finally, for any rules that
are based on already existing rules, I wanted to follow that information
with the original rule and any deviations from that original rule.</p>
<p>Once I had the first rule done, the remaining twelve rules were relatively
easy.  Most of the content for these documents was already in the source
code for the rule or the source code for the tests for that rule. It
was just a matter of extracting that information and restructing it
for the documentation.  The remaining information needed for the…</p>
<h2 id="xx_1">xx<a class="headerlink" href="#xx_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This change stemmed from a simple test that I made of the configuration
for rule Md022.  When I set the configuration value to a negative number,
the [foundation] for the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class did not complain.
Given the state of that class, that was the correct behavior.  However,
in my mind, I had set that configuration to an invalid value, and I wanted
to know that it was invalid instead of the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class
assuming the default.  Basically, I wanted to enable “strict configuration
mode” for the
that instance of the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class.</p>
<p>Starting with the tests, I added two new tests for Rule md022 with a negative
number specified for the <code>lines_below</code> configuration value for Rule md022.
One of those tests was created with my proposed “strict configuration mode”
enabled and the other test was created without it enabled. The test without
the new mode enabled passed right away, returning errors for the <code>lines_above</code>
value which had a valid value of <code>2</code>, but not returning any errors for
the invalid <code>lines_below</code> value.  With the <code>alternating_heading_types.md</code>
Markdown file and the default value for <code>lines_below</code>, that was the correct
response.  </p>
<p>With the base test working, I needed to add the code to wire up a new
command line switch with the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class.  Having added
new command line switches before, I knew it was only a small amount of
effort to change the <code>main.py</code> module to add the argument:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_argument</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="s2">"--strict-config"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">dest</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"strict_configuration"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"store_true"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">help</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"throw an error if configuration is bad, instead of assuming default"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and then a similarly small amount of effort to pass it into the properties class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strict_configuration</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enable_strict_mode</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As the <code>enable_strict_mode</code> function did not exist, I created it as a simple
function that enables the flag as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">enable_strict_mode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">"""</span>
<span class="sd">        Sets struct mode to True to enable it.</span>
<span class="sd">        """</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__strict_mode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I did think back and forth on whether to provide an “enable” function or
a “setter” function, but landed on the “enable” function.  The easier way
to set the <code>self.__strict_mode</code> member variable is to pass it in as one
of the arguments to the constructor function.</p>
<p>Thinking through various
scenarios, I came to the conclusion that everything boiled down to two
scenarios.
In the first scenario, whether to use strict mode at the
creation of the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> instance is know and is passed
into the constructor when it is created.  In the second scenario, that
decision needs to be delayed to a later point where it is known. In that
case, it makes more sense to start with the strict mode disabled, enabling
strict mode if required.  [wrap it up nicely]</p>

<p>So this one was a bit weird, but it had been on my mind for a while.  When
I was going through the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">GFM Specification</a>
to verify one of the past issues dealing with Atx Heading elements, I read the
following two lines from the section on Atx Headings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ATX heading consists of a string of characters, parsed as inline content,
between an opening sequence of 1–6 unescaped # characters and an optional
closing sequence of any number of unescaped # characters. The opening
sequence of # characters must be followed by a
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#space">space</a> or by the end of line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very specifically, it mentions a <code>space</code> character and not any <code>whitespace</code>
characters.  I remember this clearly, because it seems to contradict the
first two lines of the section on Tabs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tabs in lines are not expanded to spaces. However, in contexts
where whitespace helps to define block structure, tabs behave
as if they were replaced by spaces with a tab stop of 4 characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That text is backed up by
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-10">example 10</a> which has
a Markdown of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">#</span><span class="err">→</span><span class="n">Foo</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and an HTML output of</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Foo<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This seems contradictory, so what to do?</p>
<h3 id="thinking-it-through">Thinking It Through<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-it-through" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I guess the best place to start is with the statement that while
all specifications try and be perfect, most specifications take
a while to get to that state.  The
<a href="gfn">GFM Specification</a>
is no different than any other specification in that regard.  To
help address that issue that I found, I posted a question to the
Markdown forums to make sure that it gets talked about.  But I
still had to do something with the parser to move it along.
But what was the right answer?</p>
<p>From my experience, most specifications are layered to provide
general context at a high level and a more specific context at
a lower level.  A good example of this could be a specification
that says “in the English language, <code>i</code> always comes before <code>e</code>”
while the specification for a particular section says “except
after <code>c</code>”.  In that given section, I then expect to
have an explanation as to why that section is an exception,
with good reasons to back that decision up.  This provides for
a good foundation in the general case, with room to change things
at a lower level if required.</p>
<p>Based on that experience and those two seemingly contradictory
statements, I decided to change the code to not allow tab
characters as part of the starting or ending hash characters
for the Atx Heading elements.  There were two big factors to
me making that change.  The first was that it was a simple
enough change, and I could always revert it if necessary with
little effort.  The second was that [more]</p>
<h3 id="resolving-the-issue">Resolving The Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-the-issue" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having made the decision to go with the more specific part of the
specification, there were some changes I needed to do.  The first
thing was to add eight new tests: two tests each rule md018, md019,
md020, and md021.  These tests are variations on existing tests that
also include tabs in the area between the hash character (<code>#</code>) and
the start of the heading text.  With those tests ready to go,
it was time to make the changes.</p>
<p>For detecting the opening part of the Atx Heading, the only change
needed in the <code>is_atx_heading</code> function was to change this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extracted_whitespace_at_start</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extract_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_index</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collect_while_character</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">new_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">" "</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">extracted_whitespace_at_start</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">new_index</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This change simply replaces the call to the generic <code>extract_whitespace</code>
function with inline code that is targetted specifically for a space character.
As the <code>collect_while_character</code> function returns slightly different information
than the <code>extract_whitespace</code> function, an extra statement is required to compute
the value for the <code>extracted_whitespace_at_start</code> variable.</p>
<p>With the code for the opening hash characters completed, I needed to shift
focus to the end hash characters.  These changes were both within the
<code>parse_atx_headings</code> function in the portion of the code after then ending
hash characters are detected and removed.  Like the changes required to
direct focus on space characters at the start of the Atx Heading element,
the end has characters required the same type of changes from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_character_at_index_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span>

            <span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="n">end_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Once again, the <code>*whitespace*</code> function calls needed to be replaced
with functions focus on the single space character.  And once again,
to keep the rest of the code the same, some extra computation was
required.</p>
<p>I tested this code in two blocks, the starting hash characters and
the ending hash characters.  This worked out really well and I was
quickly able to get both changes made and tested.  While it was
not a big change, it was one more thing off the list, so it was
good.</p>
