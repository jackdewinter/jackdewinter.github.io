<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/05/10/markdown-linter-road-to-initial-release-fine-tuning-plugins/">last article</a>, I talked about
the work I did to fine tune the plugins and to start documenting them for the release.
With the plugin rules fine-tuned and notes for them in hand, I proceded to
resolve some final issues that were in the way of a clean release.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The list is definitely getting shorter.  My goal for this stretch was to get every
item in the issues list resolved except for the documentation task.  I wanted to
get a good start on that task, but I knew that it would take more than a couple
of days to get the documentation into a state that I would feel good with. After
all, if it took me almost 18 months to get the code to the initial release state,
I was not going to get the documentation done overnight.  However, I could pave the
way for me to focus solely on that documentation for the next week!</p>

<p>I am going to share a bit of a secret with you.  As someone who has
Autism, I generally get between two and four headaches a week.  Sometimes
they are from too many people and sometimes they are from old injuries
done in my youth.  As such, I rarely have a week with less than two
headaches.  While working on the project in the last three weeks,
I have had one long continuous three-week headache, with only brief
episodes of peace during that time.</p>
<p>That is, until Sunday, which was yesterday.  I am not sure if it was me taking care of
myself or if the headache had just run its course. I do not care.  The
fact that I woke up yesterday with no headache and went to bed
yesterday with no headache, with no headache between those two points.
That was enough for me.</p>
<p>And it showed on Sunday when I did some work on the PyMarkdown
project followed by picking up the notes for this article and
working on it.  For both tasks, I was able to figure things more
clearly and more easily, allowing me to be more concise in what I wanted to
accomplish.  After three weeks of pain and fog, it was a blessing.</p>
<p>I would be lying if I did not admit that sometimes it was a bit of an
uphill battle for me emotionally.  I know that I am very close to
the project’s initial release and I just wanted to do “five more
minutes” of work to get me that much closer to that goal line.  However,
in my experience,
rarely have I ever heard “five more minutes” and have it mean exactly that.
Usually it means “until I get this done”.  And if I am being honest,
I know for me that would have meant that five minutes would have
blown up to at least 30 minutes, if not a couple of hours.</p>
<p>It was not always easy.  But making sure that I took the time to
deal with life and make sure that I was working on the project
for the right reasons and in the right mindset was the right
thing for me to do.  Yes, I know I am behind in my plans for
the initial release.  But I also know that I can finish the
remaining tasks off with a positive attitude and momentum.</p>
<p>And for me, doing things (my version of) right is one of the
reasons that I started working on my own projects.</p>
<h2 id="atx-headings-part-2">Atx Headings, Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#atx-headings-part-2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having forgotten to run the Black code formatter before the last couple of
commits, I executed the formater on the code base with roughly the expected
number of reformats present in the code.  Doing some more digging into the
work I just completed on Atx Headings, I found a couple of issues.</p>
<p>When I fixed the Atx Heading parsing to not include tab characters as
part of the allowed heading whitespace after the starting hash characters,
I had neglected to make the same change for the ending hash characters.
As such, when I added four new scenario tests to verify that only
starting and ending space characters were allowed, the after tests
both failed.</p>
<p>It did not take me long to single out the responsible code.
Having recently been in that part of the code, I knew that
there was a good chance that the error was in the recent work
to deal with tab characters and space characters in Atx Heading
tokens.  With that knowledge, it was less than five minutes
before I was able to change this code to handle the end of an
Atx Closed Heading whitespace collection:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">end_index</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">extracted_whitespace_before_end</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extract_whitespace_from_end</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">remaining_line</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>into the end of an Atx Closed Heading space collection:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">collect_backwards_while_character</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">remaining_line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">remaining_line</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">" "</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">end_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">non_whitespace_index</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">extracted_whitespace_before_end</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">remaining_line</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">end_index</span><span class="p">:]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With that fix in place, all four scenario tests were passing.
I did double check my scenario tests to see why I had missed this,
with little insight gained.  My guess is that I was just eager
to get things done and missed one part of the solution.
I did find it before it was released, so I was not too upset.
But I knew I needed to make sure I tempered my “need for speed”
against my need to do things properly.</p>
<p>And it was with that that I knew I was now on to the big issue
that I had been thinking about in the back of my mind for weeks:
pragmas.</p>
<h2 id="pragmas">Pragmas<a class="headerlink" href="#pragmas" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With a long history in the software development industry,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/pragma-directives-and-the-pragma-keyword">pragmas</a>
are not something that developers regularly see these days.  Historically,
pragmas provide additional information to a specific compiler during
compile time, giving the compiler extra context to consider.
While more famous in the C and C++ languages, the
concept of pragmas has often been borrowed by linters and analyzers to allow
the source document to provide additional information to guide
on how that document is to be analyzed.  By default,
if the process does not understand a given pragma, it is ignored.
I believe this is one of the reasons that most pragmas look line
inline comments or something similar.</p>
<p>One of the benchmarks I have for the PyMarkdown project is how
well and how quickly it analyzes the directories containing the
Markdown version of the articles that make up my blog.  Up until
I added support for Front-Matter tokens, it was rather messy.
However, with that being implemented, a lot of the failures due
to Front-Matter Markdown being misinterpreted was gone.  I was
now able to make some serious progress on dealing with those rule
violations that were showing up when I scanned my blog.</p>
<p>Out of the 27 errors that were being reported by scanning
the directory, only 12 of those were what I would consider real
errors.  While the other 15 errors were being properly reported,
except for 2 instances of a parser error that I
uncovered, the remaining 13 were “allowable” failures. These
failures were allowable because I wanted to make the conscious
choice to ignore the project’s scan results for those 13 separate
instances.  The only problem was that I did not have a way
to mark those errors as being “allowable”.  That is where
pragmas came in to play.</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-a-good-design">Starting With A Good Design<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-a-good-design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While there are times that I feel it is okay to jump in to writing
code, those times are few and far between.  Even if the design is
some scribbles on paper or some notes in a readmd.md file, I have
always found benefit in taking the time to work through the base
scenarios involved with a given project.  After all, the least
costly software change to make is one that has not been coded yet.</p>
<p>This design was no different.  Starting with scenario tests, I
created a set of new scenario tests that started to fill out my
design.  Like other linters, to keep the readability high,
I decided on a simple pragma indicator and format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;!--</span> <span class="nv">pyml</span> <span class="nv">disable</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">next</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">line</span> <span class="nv">no</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">multiple</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">space</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">atx</span><span class="o">--&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The entire pragma would be wrapped in a comment.  That way, if there
was something only slightly wrong with the pragma, the parser would
consider it an HTML comment section, and treat it accordingly. Within
the pragma, the <code>{space}pyml{space}</code> sequence would kick off the
pragma, something that was likely not to be repeated elsewhere.</p>
<p>At that point, all that was left was the command structure.  Looking
at various other linters, they all seemed to have 8 or more commands
for specifying regions, saving state, restoring state, and all that.
While they probably have reasons for all those commands, I wanted to
keep things simple.  From my experience, I never use those other
commands because I only want to suppress the failure on the next
line.  I am not sure if everyone will feel the same way, but it was
a good place to start.</p>
<p>With the comment line and command structure done, it was on to more
practical issues.  It made sense to me to search and store pragmas
in a manner independent of the tokenization.  For me, pragmas and
tokens are different concepts with different responsibilities. Tokens
explain what the document is while pragmas provide instructions to
the rules engine on what rules to apply (or not apply) and when.
Given those restrictions, it made sense to add code to the
Container Processor’s <code>parse_line_for_container_blocks</code> function.
By adding the code there, the decision on whether to interpret
a line normally or as a pragma line could be made without affecting
anything else in the parser.</p>
<p>With a collection of pragmas, I now needed someplace to store them.
Creating a new <code>PragmaToken</code> class allowed me to add the pragma
information at the end of token stream for storage, but also allow
the token to be easily extracted.  Then, in the <code>PluginManager</code> class, I
could add code to take the data within the <code>PragmaToken</code> and
parse it for correctness.  Assuming a line was a correctly
formatted pragma, I could then put it into a simple format that
could be referenced by the <code>log_scan_failure</code> function to
determine if a failure should be logged or not.</p>
<p>Working things through on paper and with sample code, I was quickly
able to tighten that design down some more.  But in the end, the
design was pretty thought out, with some good tests written before
one line of feature code was written.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-detection">Implementation - Detection<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-detection" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After all that focus on the design of the feature, there really
were not many surprises that I encountered.  A new <code>__look_for_pragmas</code>
function was added to the <code>ContainerProcessor</code> class, only activating
if an HTML comment was found with no whitespace before it and
without being contained within a Block Quote element or a List element.</p>
<p>From there, there was some simple code to determine if we have a
pragma, but not verifying that a valid pragma was present:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">was_extended_prefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">startswith</span><span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>One of the small surprises that I came across during my design phase
was
that some of the parsers have plugins that support a concept of
a “hidden” comment.  These are HTML-style comments that begin
with a sequence of <code>&lt;!---</code> instead of <code>&lt;!--</code>.  While these
constructs are still valid comments, they are easy to spot and
therefore easy to remove when parsing the document.  By supporting
both a normal comment and this hidden comment for pragmas, I
could enable people to write pragmas that would not show up
in the rendered HTML output of any parser that supports them.
It was a small change, but a good one.</p>
<p>Other than that, the rest of the code simply
looking for something that looks like a comment that starts
with some whitespace, the text <code>pyml</code>, and some more whitespace.
If it finds it, it adds it to the <code>pragma_lines</code> dictionary using the
line number as the index.  Also returning <code>True</code> in those cases,
the <code>ContainerProcessor</code> can then discard that entire line without
affecting the token stream.  When all the tokens have been collected,
if the <code>pragma_lines</code> dictionary contains any elements, a <code>PragmaToken</code>
is created with that dictionary and added to the token stream.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-compilation">Implementation - Compilation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-compilation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The compilation step was also relatively straightforward.  In the <code>compile_pragmas</code>
function, the keys for the <code>pragma_lines</code> property of the <code>PragmaToken</code>
instance are used to get an ordered list of the line numbers for
each pragma in the document.  Compilation of the pragmas was
achieved by simply iterating through each pragma in order.  For
each pragma, the function follows code like the detection code above,
the remaining information in the pragma becoming the command and
any relevant command data.</p>
<p>Verifying the bulk of the commands was easy.  No command? Report
a pragma failure.  Command not understood? Report a pragma failure.
Missing pragma command data? Report a pragma failure.  If anything
did not look exactly right, just report an error.  Simple.</p>
<p>That left the function to handle the <code>disable-next-line</code> command, which
looked like this:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>The small change from the design here was that I wanted to be
able to collapse the rule ids and the rule aliases down into
the rule ids.  To that extent, I changed local references of
<code>all_ids</code> in the rule registration code to <code>self.__all_ids</code>
so that the pragma compiler could make use of them.</p>
<p>Other than that, the command expects a comma separated list of
ids and aliases to follow the <code>disable-next-line</code> command. If
there is an empty id, it reports a pragma failure.  If not,
it looks for it in the <code>self.__all_ids</code> dictionary, which
is a map from any valid identifier (id or alias) to the
plugin object.  If it is found in that dictionary, the
<code>normalized_id</code> variable is set and added to the set of
ids to disable.  If not found, it reports a pragma failure.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-suppressing-the-failure">Implementation - Suppressing the Failure<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-suppressing-the-failure" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the rest of the work on this feature, the suppression part
was very simple.  The last two lines of the last example are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">processed_ids</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__document_pragmas</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">actual_line_number</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">processed_ids</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To keep things simple, the only existing command suppresses one
or more rules being triggered on the following line.  Therefore,
one is added to the line number of the pragma, and the set
<code>processed_ids</code> is stored in the dictionary <code>self.__document_pragmas</code>.</p>
<p>Then, the <code>log_scan_failure</code> function was altered to add this
code at the beginning:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__document_pragmas</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">line_number</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__document_pragmas</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">id_set</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__document_pragmas</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">line_number</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">rule_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rule_id</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">rule_id</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">id_set</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, if there are compiled pragmas and the line number of the
log scan failure is in the dictionary of pragmas, further processing
is required.  The <code>rule_id</code> of the failure that is being reported
is looked for in the <code>id_set</code> of ids, and if there is a match,
then the reporting of that failure is aborted.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up<a class="headerlink" href="#wrap-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To be honest, I was underwhelmed when I got to the final part of
the implementation.  After all that work, it was less than 10 lines
that it took to implement the part where the log scan
failure was suppressed.  The hard work was making sure that I
had good scenario tests from the beginning.</p>
<p>And to spread some good word on Test Driven Development, let
me also supply some extra information on why I like scenario
tests so much.  While it is nice to have a solid design, I feel
that those scenario tests help me pull a design from the
abstract world into the concrete world.  Everyone can argue
about what was really meant when I say “data store”, but
if I actually write a scenario test that sets up a data store,
it makes the entire concept and usage of the data store more
real.  For me, that helps me ground myself and my designs.</p>
<p>After all that work, I then was able to go through the remaining
failures and determine if any of those failures were “allowable”.
By allowable, I mean that I acknowledge the failure and allow
it to be suppressed because of a conscious decision.  By using
pragmas, I can then suppress those failures in a simple and
discoverable manner.  And by also supporting the <code>&lt;!---</code> sequence,
I can also make it so the pragma is hidden.  All good work!</p>
<h2 id="blank-lines-and-lists">Blank Lines and Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#blank-lines-and-lists" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am not sure if I have talked about this small issue before, but
the parser has long had a slight glitch in how the tokens are
recorded for a Blank Line element that ends a List element.
When the Blank Line element occurs, a Blank Line token is recorded,
and it triggers the code that closes any existing List elements
or Block Quote elements.</p>
<p>While the tokens come out in the correct order for Block Quotes tokens,
the Blank Line token always comes out before the end List token.
When testing what the HTML output would be for this scenario, everything
is fine because a Blank Line token is ignored by the HTML generator.
Even the end List token element is ignored, except for resetting the
list state.  As the only issue is the ordering of the tokens, and
not their output, this is a small glitch.</p>
<p>As this is a small glitch, this is easily worked around.  Because
it is a small glitch with an easy workaround, I long ago decided
to keep things the way they were until something else forced me
to fix this issue.  While it only caused me to put this issue at
the top of the issues list, it was enough to cross the line that
I had drawn.  The reason?  Rule md022.</p>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery<a class="headerlink" href="#discovery" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of my standard “smoke” tests is to use the project to scan the
directories containing the Markdown for my own blog’s articles.  As
the plugin rules got cleaned up, especially with the addition of pragmas,
the output for the scan got progressively cleaner.  With pragmas
in place, I was able to disable all the reported errors that were
legitimate errors, but errors that I decided to ignore.  That
left only two “real” errors. Those two errors occurred in two Markdown
documents with sections that looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">grouping</span> <span class="nv">of</span> <span class="nv">values</span>? <span class="nv">Extra</span> <span class="nv">code</span> <span class="nv">required</span>.
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">hierarchy</span> <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">nesting</span>? <span class="nv">Extra</span> <span class="nv">code</span> <span class="nv">required</span>.

## <span class="nv">Configuration</span> <span class="nv">Type</span> <span class="mi">2</span>: <span class="nv">Grouped</span>

<span class="nv">The</span> <span class="k">next</span> <span class="nv">step</span> <span class="nv">up</span> <span class="nv">from</span> <span class="nv">the</span> <span class="nv">simple</span> <span class="nv">type</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">grouped</span> <span class="nv">type</span>.  <span class="k">While</span> <span class="nv">it</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">a</span> <span class="nv">step</span> <span class="nv">up</span> <span class="nv">from</span> <span class="nv">the</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The error that was being reported was a triggered rule md022, complaining
that there was not a single line above the Atx Heading element.  Looking at the
Markdown itself, it was clear there is a blank line before the Atx Heading.  At
that point I looked at the tokens being output for the Markdown document and it
was then that I noticed the reversed tokens described above. It was a lightbulb
moment.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#resolution" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As I mentioned above, the first thing I did was to add a new item to the issues list.
I did tell myself that one more issue related to this case of improperly ordered tokens was
enough to make me fix it, and I wanted to keep my word.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I needed something to address the issue until after
the initial release.  Looking at the code, one small change seemed obvious
but dangerous.  So, I added the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_end</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>before the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__blank_line_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__is_leaf_end_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__is_container_end_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I felt it was dangerous because it was easy.  Hopefully not sounding
paranoid, it was too easy.  With that one change, any ending of a list
would not reset the rule’s <code>__blank_line_count</code> member variable.</p>
<p>To this date, I still think that the fix was too easy, and sometimes
play around with scenarios that I think can fail it.  Thinking more
deeply on this issue, I believe that my sense of the tokens not being
correct has crossed over into my sense that the fix is not correct.
Furthermore, I believe that the feeling is still present because I
know that the correct way to fix this is to fix the tokens, and not
to temporarily fix it.</p>
<p>But whether I feel 100% comfortable with the decision to delay
the fixing of the tokens until after the initial release, I believe
that was the right decision to make.  And while I do not feel
comfortable with the temporary fix, I have to find peace in the
fact that I know it is going to be temporary.</p>
<h2 id="strict-mode-cleanup">Strict Mode Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#strict-mode-cleanup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After implementing the strict configuration mode previously, there were still some loose
ends to clean up with its usage.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-value">Reading The Value<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-the-value" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The biggest “loose end” that I needed to deal with was
around initializing this mode from both the command line and configuration.
To get things working, I had placed the following code at the end of the <code>__set_initial_state</code>
function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strict_configuration</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enable_strict_mode</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While that code was correct, there were a few things that were not quite right
with it.  To deal with that properly, I pulled that code out into its own function,
<code>__initialize_strict_mode</code> and added some extra code before it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__initialize_strict_mode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">effective_strict_configuration</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strict_configuration</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">effective_strict_configuration</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">effective_strict_configuration</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_boolean_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"mode.strict-config"</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">effective_strict_configuration</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enable_strict_mode</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With this in place, it was now following the command-config-default pattern
that I want for all project configurations.  Only if the command line flag is
set will the value of <code>args.strict_configuration</code> be <code>True</code>, so no need for
fancy comparisons against <code>None</code> there.  If it is not set, then the code tries
to look for a value in the configuration, before adopting the default of
<code>False</code>.  While the <code>False</code> is not explicitly satisfied, it is the default
of the <code>get_boolean_property</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-place-the-call">Where To Place The Call?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-place-the-call" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the functionality localized to a function,
the next thing that I needed to focus on was the placement of the function call
to the new <code>__initialize_strict_mode</code> function. It did not feel right in the
<code>__set_initial_state</code> function, but I was indecisive on where to place it.
Working through some scenarios by the time-tested method of trial by
scribbles, I finally landed on placing the call to <code>__initialize_strict_mode</code>
right before the call to <code>__initialize_logging</code>.  The way I saw it, there
were safeguards and debugging around providing bad information to the
<code>__set_initial_state</code> function, but not after that point.  Putting the
call after the logging call would leave the logging call unprotected, so
I placed it between the two.</p>
<p>The only part that was left of that was to try and protect the strict
configuration mode itself.  It was when I went to add the <code>strict_mode=True</code>
argument to the <code>get_boolean_property</code> function call that I noticed
something.  I noticed that I had not specified the <code>strict_mode</code> argument
for boolean properties.  It was not a difficult fix to make, but it caused
me to work through my design again, just to make sure I had it right that
time.</p>
<p>With that part of the changes done, there was just one part left.</p>
<h3 id="handling-failures">Handling Failures<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-failures" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Initially, I used the phrase “Handling Failures Properly” for
this section, but I had second thoughts about that.  With things coded
the way they were, the only thing that was left was to make some small
changes to the scenario tests to record the failures.  At that point,
the error was being reported properly, but I had to take an extra
step to validate it: setting the <code>--stack-trace</code> command line option
on the test that was reporting the failure.</p>
<p>The example that I mainly worked with was the <code>test_markdown_with_bad_strict_config_type</code>
scenario test.  When I executed that test, the error that I got
back was a stack trace with this text near the end of the error’s
message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    raise ValueError(
        ValueError: The value for property 'mode.strict-config' must be of type 'bool'.
        )
</pre></div>
<p>While the right error was being raised, I thought the project should
handle the presentation of that error in a more readable fashion.</p>
<p>To do that, I added the following snippet of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">this_exception</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">formatted_error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"Configuration Error: {this_exception}"</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__handle_error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">formatted_error</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to the try/except/finally clause in the <code>__initialize_parser</code> function
and in the <code>main</code> function.  While not a substantial change, it covered
the two areas capable of raising these <code>ValueError</code> instances.  With
that error covered, I was then able to print out a more readable, concise,
and actionable error message:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Configuration Error: The value for property 'mode.strict-config' must be of type 'bool'.
</pre></div>
<p>With a couple of extra formatting changes, this task was completed.</p>
<h2 id="and-with-that">And With That<a class="headerlink" href="#and-with-that" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There was only one item in the issues list section labelled
<code>Priority 1 - Must Solve Before Initial</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- command line and configuration documentation
</pre></div>
<p>While I did check in <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/17304b3ef580ec71678c450ab6c2a1e669b4e90a">a commit</a>
for the work I did during the week, I want to save talking about that work until
next week.  It was a task that was both very easy and very difficult to do, so I
want to make sure that I talk about it with some distance between working on it
and talking about it.  That and its only mostly done, and I would prefer to finish
it before talking about it.</p>
<p>A good reason to check in next week though, no?</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Phew… while there are still items in the issues list, there is only
one issue remaining in the priority 1 section: documentation.  I am not
sure if this makes sense to anyone, but that is a big relief to me.
Having taken the time to document my work each week, I am not
worried about writing the documentation.</p>
<p>Getting to this point has been a roller coaster ride, with both positive
and negative hills to climb along the way, but I feel good about this.
Sure, there are some little things that I need to fix here and there,
but I believe the code for the project is in really good shape to be
released.  I was not sure it was ever going to get that way, but it is
there now.</p>
<p>I guess part of that feeling is confidence because I am literally throwing
everything against it.  After the pragmas and one little fix, I can now
scan every file for my website without any non-allowed failures getting
in the way.  If I want to, I can probably add something to the linter
at a later stage to record those pragmas in a reportable fashion.  But
for now, if I want to find them out, I just have to do a simple search
through my Markdown files for <code>&lt;!---</code>, and that is easy enough.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I had started on the documentation, I needed some time to get it
into a good shape to talk about.  That is what I am going to be talking about
next week.
Stay tuned!</p>
