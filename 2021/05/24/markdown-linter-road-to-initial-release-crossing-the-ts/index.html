<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/05/17/markdown-linter-road-to-initial-release-dotting-the-is/">last article</a>, I talked about
resolving some issues that were in the way of a clean release.  In this
article, I talk about getting the documentation cleaned up and ready for release.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the reasons that I started writing these articles is to talk about how
the project evolved throughout its development.  But equally as
important, I wanted to get more comfortable with my skills as a writer.
While I am not sure how much those skills have grown, I do feel that they have grown.
And in this stage of the project, I know that I need to leverage those
skills to write good, solid project documentation.</p>
<p>In my eyes, documentation can make or break a project.  I have
glanced over and dismissed many projects on GitHub after two minutes or
less.  I usually make that decision based on the base project document,
the <code>readme.md</code> file, and whether that file made the project look interesting or
applicable to what I was searching for.  To be clear, I admit that it is
entirely possible that those projects I dismissed were either interesting
or what I needed. But without good project documentation to provide that
information to me, the chance that I will find the
right information to make that judgement call is a fraction
of what it could be with good project documentation.</p>
<p>In other words, I have worked hard to come up with the PyMarkdown linter.
It was time to use that same passion to document the linter so I can
provide people with the information they need to make their own judgements.</p>
<p>Given my own personal high bar for documentation, I was under no illusion
that this was going to be easy.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commits between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/17304b3ef580ec71678c450ab6c2a1e669b4e90a">16 May 2021</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/6efc9044e5c93dd0848cece854e0463c04fcd299">23 May 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coding-vs-documentation">Coding Vs Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#coding-vs-documentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While this block of work did contain a few small tweaks here and there,
the bulk of the work was on getting the documentation ready for release.
And if I may be blunt, there is a large difference between writing code
and writing documentation.</p>
<p>In creating the PyMarkdown project, there were a lot of times that I was
not sure what the next task to do was, so I referred to my
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/issues.md">Issues List</a>.
If I was not sure about whether or not something was in scope, I referred
back to my article on
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/12/08/markdown-linter-collecting-requirements/">Collecting Requirements</a>.
If a particular Markdown snippet was not covered in the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GFM Specification</a>,
I would run the sample through the
<a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/">Babelmark</a> webpage.  Before
anything gets committed to the repository<sup id="fnref:mostly"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mostly">1</a></sup>, I execute a script
that ensures that I am following good coding practices, reformatting my
code in the process. And to top things off, because I love Test Driven
Development, I add
the Scenario Tests for everything before I code them up.  This provides
an additional level of structure to how I develop features or fix bugs.</p>
<p>And that is the point I wanted to get across.  When I am writing code,
there is a lot of structure all over the place.  From picking something
off the Issues List to running my pre-commit script, there is tons
of structure built into the processes that I use to develop software.
In the cases where I sometime forget to follow a given process, that
process or other processes that I have are able to cover for that lapse
of process.  Sure, it is redundant, but it works well for me.</p>
<p>So, when I started going through the documentation to bring it up
to the level that I thought it deserves, I wanted to follow
procedures like the ones that helped me develop the source code
side of the project.  The question was, how was I going to do that?</p>
<h2 id="starting-with-requirements">Starting With Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-requirements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Even though I wrote it over a year ago, I still credit the creation
of the section
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/12/08/markdown-linter-collecting-requirements/#what-are-the-requirements">What Are The Requirements?</a>
with its fair share of the success for the project.  By taking the
time to sit down and figure out what I wanted and recording that
in a format that I could easily reference, I did myself a huge favor.</p>
<p>That act of creating the article gave me a solid touchstone that
I still refer to for guidance.  Especially with the summary
paragraph after that list detailing why I thought those requirements
were important, it crystallized what I wanted to do with the project
into a bedrock set of concepts that I can rely on.</p>
<h3 id="doing-the-research">Doing The Research<a class="headerlink" href="#doing-the-research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In my attempt to replicate the success of my coding effort with my documentation
effort, I knew that I needed to dig
deep and figure out what I liked and did not like about various project
home pages out there.  The things that I liked, I wanted to replicate,
the things that I did not like, I wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>So, like always, I started to research.  While that can also read
as “Jack looks at websites”, it was not really that easy to do.
I went to the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/">Cool GitHub Projects sub-reddit</a>
and started to look at different GitHub projects.  That process helped
me to formulate my first requirement.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-1-why-should-i-use-this-project">Requirement 1: Why Should I Use This Project?<a class="headerlink" href="#requirement-1-why-should-i-use-this-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing that really struck me about different projects was
how far each project made someone read until they could figure out
whether the project was right for them.  In many of the projects that
I looked at, instructions on how to install the project preceded
an attempt to answer that question.  That is in the approximately
60% of the projects that provided any attempt at that answer.
To me, the absence of any answer to the question of “why?” did not make
sense.</p>
<p>That was when I focused on what this requirement meant to me.  The
first thing that the successful answers to that question did for
me was to present the reader with a short introduction paragraph
at the start of the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#pymarkdown">readme.md file</a>.
Those projects presented a good, simple paragraph to allow the
reader to determine if the foundational elements of the project
met their criteria or not.  If it does not meet their needs,
no harm, no foul, only taking up the minimum amount of time needed
to help the reader figure that out.</p>
<p>If their criteria were met, the next part of that section needed
to provide information to the reader on why that project is better
than other similar projects at accomplishing their task.  At this
point, the reader is hooked and wants to learn more about the
project.  I did observe that the good projects provided readers with
a good selection of bullet points about the project.  It did not
need to be anything heavy, just enough to convince the reader that
they the project is serious and encourage them to read on.</p>
<h4 id="its-essentially-an-elevator-pitch-conversation">It’s Essentially An Elevator Pitch + Conversation<a class="headerlink" href="#its-essentially-an-elevator-pitch-conversation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Basically, to use business terminology, I needed to prepare an
elevator pitch followed by a two-minute conversation.  Getting the
reader into the “elevator” was them getting to the project
website in the first place.  I then had between three
and five sentences while they are “in the elevator” to either
gain their attention or to have them politely decline.  If I
gain their attention, I then have a quick “two-minute conversation”
with them to convince them to talk about it some more before
they continue on to where they were going.  Anything more
than that is imposing on them, which will negatively affect
their interest on your conversation.</p>
<p>While this may not seem accurate to some, I encourage readers to try
this experiment for themselves.  Go to the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects/">Cool GitHub Projects sub-reddit</a>,
and look for three cool projects to get interested in.  Pay
attention to how much reading you do of the project documentation,
knowing that I have asked for three projects to be selected.</p>
<p>If you follow the norm, you want to do a thorough job, but
you also want to be efficient.  You want the information that
helps you make that decision up front as much as possible.
You want the most relevant facts laid out in plain language
so you can easily digest them.</p>
<p>If the reader is still paying attention, it is then time
to take them to the next step: the test drive.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-2-how-can-i-take-a-test-drive">Requirement 2: How Can I Take A Test Drive?<a class="headerlink" href="#requirement-2-how-can-i-take-a-test-drive" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I hope that I do not sound like a used car salesman, but the
mindset that I had when getting past the “Am I Interested?”
part was pretty close to what I have experienced buying
a car.  Assuming that I was interested enough in the GitHub
project to spend time trying to get it working on my machine,
I needed a quick and easy way to install it and verify that
the simple case works.</p>
<p>To be blunt, when I try out a GitHub project, I just want to
see any result, no matter how simple.  Fine tuning and more
complex cases can come later.  I know that if I cannot get a
quick confirmation that the project works on my machine in
the simplest case, I know that the more complex cases are
already a no-go.
Essentially, I want to “kick the tires” and “take it out
for a spin” and see if it works as advertised.  If not, I
want to move to the next project on as quickly as possible.
Depending on my interest in a project, I might be willing
to ask one or two questions, but that is usually the limit
of what I am willing to invest in an, in my mind, unproven project.</p>
<p>For the PyMarkdown project, that meant adding a couple of different
sections.  The first section was the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#requirements">Requirements section</a>
to specify that the project needs Python 3.8 or later to function.
While I do not find version 3.8 or higher to be a deal breaker, some people
might, so get it out of the way quickly.  Following that, I want a simple
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#installation">Installation section</a>
with as few steps as possible.  It does not have to install and parse
everything, but it does have to install and parse something
right away.</p>
<p>I then want to follow that up with what I see as the “Test Drive”.
For me, this section is the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#how-to-use">How To Use section</a>,
teeing up the execution of the
simple case that is going to show the project working. Keeping
the car analogy in place, if I am driving an unfamiliar car,
I want to know where everything is in case something goes
wrong during the test drive.  That led me to add the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#if-you-get-stuck">If You Get Stuck section</a>
to help the reader with the help functionality.</p>
<p>With everything else already in place, I added the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#prerequisites">Prerequisites section</a>
to help set the stage for the test drive.  Almost every time
I have test driven a car, the salesman will set expectations for
the drive and how it will proceed.  For the project, this
section provides two slightly different examples of Markdown text,
one that emits violations and one that does not.  These examples
were not very complicated, but just complicated enough to show the
project working properly.</p>
<p>Finally, with everything else set up, it was time for the test
drive.  This meant adding the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#basic-scanning">Basic Scanning section</a>
to allow the user to test the project.  This section has only
two goals.  The first is to show the PyMarkdown linter working against the
example files created in the Prerequisites section.  The second is
to provide sample output to allow the user to verify that everything
is installed and working properly.  Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>For me, this was the path to making sure that the
reader can get the project running on their system.  And I
believe that the documentation will get the reader to that
same point as quickly as possible.  Requirement met.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-3-turning-it-up-to-eleven">Requirement 3: Turning It Up To Eleven<a class="headerlink" href="#requirement-3-turning-it-up-to-eleven" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite the various origin of the phrase
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven">“turning it up to eleven”</a>,
the meaning fit right into what I wanted to convey.  At this
point in the documentation, the documentation has captured the
reader’s attention and (hopefully) those readers have the
project installed and running on their system. This meant
I needed to transition from showing the project working
on a simple example to showing the project working on a more
complex example.  At the same time, I must strike a
balance between presenting a more complex example and not
overloading the reader and scaring them away.  After some
though, I determined that I needed to focus on between
two and four of the most important features or concepts
in this next step.</p>
<p>As the PyMarkdown linter has a solid set of features, I needed
to find some way to reduce the list of features into that small
set of features that I believe are the most important features
to show someone who has just installed the project.
Seeing as I have been with the project
from the very beginning, this was no easy feat.  I needed to
try and remove my own biases and come up with no more than
three features that I hoped were indispensable to most
new users.</p>
<p>After scribbling down all the features, some patterns started
to emerge.  One very interesting pattern emerged when I
started drawing lines from each feature to any other feature
that it depended on.  When all was said and done, there
were three features or concepts at the center of everything
else: rules and rule plugins, rule violations and their format,
and the ability to enable and disable rule plugins.</p>
<p>It was at that point that I knew that I had the three
sections that I wanted to focus on in the main <code>readme.md</code> file.
As the main purpose of the linter was to allow rules be
run against Markdown documents, the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#rules">Rules section</a>
was an obvious starting section.  From there, I felt it was
important to relate to the user how any rule violations are
reported and how to read them, which lead to my creating the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#rule-violation-format">Rule Violation Format section</a>.
Then, the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#basic-configuration">Basic Configuration section</a>
was created to provide an introduction to configuration by showing
the user how to enable and disable rules.</p>
<p>My goal for these sections was not to cover everything, but
to specifically cover the basic concepts that a new user needs
to get the project up and running effectively.  With those
bases covered, I had to make another decision: how do I
deal with the remaining concepts about the project?</p>
<p>Going back to the GitHub projects that I thought did a
good job on documentation, I was able to make another observation.
Those projects were good at drawing a line between what
to include in the main <code>readme.md</code> file and what to delegate
to other documents.  When I thought about it, the logic there
made a lot of sense to me.  Keep the <code>readme.md</code> file limited to
the most important concepts, and delegate the other concepts
to other files.</p>
<p>To that extent, I grouped the remaining concepts into 3 main
groups:
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#advanced-scanning">Advanced Scanning</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#advanced-configuration">Advanced Configuration</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#advanced-rule-plugins">Advanced Rule Plugins</a>.
For me, this struck a good balance because I was still able
to show interested readers that there was more to the project,
but at the same time, not overload them.</p>
<p>With all the main concepts addressed, there was just one
requirement left to work on.</p>
<h3 id="requirement-4-wrap-it-up-nicely">Requirement 4: Wrap It Up Nicely<a class="headerlink" href="#requirement-4-wrap-it-up-nicely" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At this point, if I have done my job right, I have gained the reader’s
attention, they have at least a simple example running on their
machine, and they have possibly played around with some of the
more advanced stuff.  For those readers who became users of
the project, I needed to do one more thing.
Wrap the <code>readme.md</code> file up in a nice package.</p>
<p>I do not mean “wrap up” in any dismissive way, far from it.  But
as someone who looks at various projects, if I have set it up on
my own machine and invested time in verify that it works, there
is one more thing I want to see.  I want to see that the project
is not abandoned and not going to go away overnight.</p>
<p>Basically, I want a couple of sections where I can ask questions
and know what is going on with the project. I also want to
know it is still going to be around in the future if I have
any more questions or feature requests.  It was time to try
and help with those questions.</p>
<h4 id="dealing-with-questions">Dealing With Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-questions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first section that I added to start addressing this concern
was the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#open-issues-and-future-plans">Open Issues and Future Plans section</a>.
From my viewpoint, I want to know what open issues are present
with a project that I am investing my time in, and I also want
to know where the project creators plan on taking the project.
After all, I need to invest some of my own time to get the
project working for my needs.  It helps for me to know if the
creator’s directions are aligned with my needs or not.</p>
<p>From there, I needed to start answering questions that any
users of the project had about the project.  For me, that
started with the
<a href="ddd">When Did Things Change section</a>
that links to the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/changelog.md">changelog.md file</a>.
For the most part, when I am looking posing questions about a
project, over 95% of those questions are either about
“how do I do X?” or “what changes?”.
This section will hopefully help answer that second question
for the users.</p>
<p>Then, if that user still has questions, the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#still-have-questions">Still Have Questions? section</a>
points them to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document.
While that document will not resolve every remaining question, over time
it should answer the most asked questions before having them
raised as more serious issues.  While not perfect, if I invest
time wisely into this document, it can reduce the number of
questions being asked in other forums.</p>
<p>Assuming that the user still has a question after consulting the
information in the previous sections, the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#contact-information">Contact Information section</a>
is there to help them understand how to get in touch with the team.
Even though that team is currently just me, I feel that it is important to
be clear on what kind of contact the user can have with me and
in what format.  It is in this section that I provided a link to
the GitHub issues tracker, suggesting its use for both bug fixes
and feature improvements.  Finally, if the user’s question is
more centered around contributing to the project, there is a
request to contact me to talk about it.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-someone-contribute">How Can Someone Contribute?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-someone-contribute" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>That brings me to the section with
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown#instructions-for-contributing">Instructions For Contributing</a>.
While this is still currently under improvement, I thought it
was important to let people know that I welcome solid contributions
that help the project along.  I also know that after 18+ months
working on this by myself, accepting any offered help is going to
be a gradual process.</p>
<h4 id="the-dull-stuff-acknowledgements">The Dull Stuff: Acknowledgements<a class="headerlink" href="#the-dull-stuff-acknowledgements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>After everything else was taken care of, the projects that
really stood out to me were the ones that took the time to thank
various people who helped the project, either directly or indirectly.
Nothing important is ever developed in a vacuum, and the wise
people talk about who helped them get to that point.</p>
<p>And to me, as I have said on other subjects, it just made sense.
The people I talk about in the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements section</a>
took time to help me out.  The least I can do is say thank you
in my own way.</p>
<h2 id="the-outline">The Outline<a class="headerlink" href="#the-outline" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>

<h2 id="filling-in-the-blanks">Filling In The Blanks<a class="headerlink" href="#filling-in-the-blanks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the requirements sketched out and the sections laid out, it
was somewhat easy to start filling in the blanks.  To be honest,
I was eager to get to work on replacing the placeholders I had
in my mind with actual text.</p>
<h3 id="first-pass">First pass<a class="headerlink" href="#first-pass" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>My goal for the first pass was to get a good start on the <code>readme.md</code>
file.  It took me a while to get working on that. But once I started,
I quickly gained momentum.  As I thought of things to add to the
documentation, I put them into one of two categories.  If the concept
fit into one of the three basic categories, I added it to the <code>readme.md</code>
file and started filling it out.  If did not, I made sure to put
it in one of the other documents, knowing that I would
get around to it in a subsequent pass.</p>
<p>And just to set things straight, yes, I initially added some extra sections
to the main <code>readme.md</code> file.  If I am being honest with myself, I believe
that I thought it was more important to capture the essence of the concept
I was working on while it was clear in my head.  I knew that I was going to
be making multiple passes through the documentation, so it would find its
way to the right section of the right document by the end of the process.</p>
<h3 id="second-pass">Second Pass<a class="headerlink" href="#second-pass" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As I focused my first pass on the main <code>readme.md</code> file, I moved my
focus on the second pass to the other documents, more specifically the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#advanced-scanning">Advanced Scanning</a>
document and the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/readme.md#advanced-configuration">Advanced Configuration</a>
document.  While it may seem boring, I just kept my head down
and worked on expanding the existing point form notes in each
document into a full-fledged documentation section.</p>
<p>It was during the creation of that documentation that I
looked at various parts of the project and found a couple
of little issues:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>- when scanning a directory, is it always recursive?
  - can have switch for recursion?
- make sure configuration versions of
  - --add-plugin
  --strict-config       throw an error if configuration is bad, instead of assuming default
  --stack-trace         if an error occurs, print out the stack trace for debug purposes
  --log-level {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
                        minimum level required to log messages
  --log-file LOG_FILE   destination file for log messages
- clean up
  pipenv run python main.py --strict-config -s log.level=$#1 scan examples
</pre></div>
<p>It was nothing serious, but they were just inconsistencies that I
was able to find by taking a wholistic look at the project through
the lens of writing the project documentation.  None of those
issues were showstoppers, but it was still good that I caught
them when I did.</p>
<p>I was confident that I could clean those issues up quickly, so I
started doing a a reading pass through the documents, from start
to end, looking for wording that I could change.  My personal writing
process is simply to keep on reading and editing the document until
it feels right, so this was part of my normal process.  As such,
it was easy to go through the documents looking for things that
I felt were out of place, and I made quick work of that task.</p>
<p>So, by the end of the second pass, I felt things were progressing
nicely.  Sure, I had some small issues to fix, and more revisions
were surely on their way, but I had the bulk of the documentation
written.  The next pass, that was going to start to be more
fit-and-finish work.</p>
<h3 id="third-pass">Third Pass<a class="headerlink" href="#third-pass" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not being one that likes having pending issues hanging over my
head, when I started my third pass, resolving those found
issues were my number one priority.  Part of that was
“scratching that itch” and part of that was logic.  I was
sure that I needed to add a new command line flag, and that
was going to require new documentation.  Might as well do
that all at once.</p>
<p>After about two hours of work, those issues were all resolved,
and with another hour of work, the documentation for the
new recursive flag was also complete.  From there, it was
just a series of reading passes over the documents, each
one looking for something slightly different.</p>
<p>The first one was a bit more fit-and-finish work, making
sure that I was selecting saying what needed to be said
in each section.  Following that, the second reading pass
was slightly different in that I was focusing more on
selecting the right words to convey the ideas in that
section.  As I believe both of those concepts are
important, that is having the right ideas expressed
in the right place and using the right words to convey
that idea, I wanted to take the time to distinctly
focus independently on each one.</p>
<p>With more confidence that I had the right content and
mostly the right words, I then proceeded to look through
the documents for spelling and grammar errors.  I am
not 100% sure that I found all the errors, but I am
confident that I found most of them.  And for that pass,
it was good enough for me.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-pass">Fourth Pass<a class="headerlink" href="#fourth-pass" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is how I could tell that I was close to the end of writing
the documentation: I was fiddling over the words and the ordering
of sentences.  It was a familiar feeling. It is something that
happens each week as I write my article, so it was an easy sign
to spot.  I knew that I could probably spend years trying to
find the perfect combination of words, so I knew I had to stop
there.  It took a bit of effort, but I stopped editing the
documents.</p>
<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-trailing-punctuation -->
<h2 id="and-that-leaves-me">And That Leaves Me…<a class="headerlink" href="#and-that-leaves-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At least for now, I stopped.  Now that I have a finished code
base and finished documentation, I want to give it all a couple
of days to sit before I run some extra tests and reread the
documentation.  I do not expect any of the tests to fail, but
I want to run them to be thorough.  Just to be sure.</p>
<p>I also do not expect any changes to the documentation,
but I want to give the documentation at least 48 hours to clear
out of my head before I look at it again.  While my weekly articles
are written more directly and in a shorter duration, all the other
articles that I write get the same mandatory 48 hour cool down
period before my final pass.  I am not
sure if it is thoroughness or paranoia, but it is my process. I
just feel better knowing that I did my final documentation pass
with a clear head, hopefully removed from all the changes and
prior versions of the documents.</p>
<p>And where does that leave me?  Unless there are any very
stunning things that I find, it means there is a good chance
that I can do the initial release this week!</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a long time getting to this point, but I was here.
From experience, I knew that I wanted to leave the project
alone for a bit to clear my head, but it was difficult. I
have spent a lot of time cleaning things up, and I wanted to
just take that extra step across the finish line.</p>
<p>It was aggravating to stop, but I knew I had to.  I knew that
I need to be objective and clear in my decision that everything
looks right, and I cannot do that until I clear my head.
Yes, I am annoyed at myself, but I know it will pass.</p>
<p>After all, chances are that I am going to do the initial
release of the project this next week, right?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After my self-imposed 48 hour cool off period, it was going to be
time to get the release ready.  Stay tuned.</p>
