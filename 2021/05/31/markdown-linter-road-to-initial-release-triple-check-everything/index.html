<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/05/24/markdown-linter-road-to-initial-release-crossing-the-ts/">last article</a>, I talked
about getting the documentation cleaned up and ready for release.  In this article,
I talk about the final changes that I needed to make to get the project ready for its
initial release.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This was it!  After many hours of work, countless hours of debugging, and too many
brain cells burnt debugging, the project was on the cusp of being ready.  I just
had a few tasks to complete before I felt confident in announcing the release of
the project.  Nothing spectacular, but just some (hopefully) small tasks to make
sure everything was in place.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commits between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/5756cf6add036436866a56ec1a6cac9c5a07d333">27 May 2021</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/d8526d3bb695e42be71f519f8bc8345c14edee86">31 May 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-initial-release-was-quiet">The True Initial Release Was Quiet<a class="headerlink" href="#the-true-initial-release-was-quiet" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The release of PyMarkdown <code>0.5.0</code> or <code>pymarkdownlnt-0.5.0</code> was
done very quietly and without much fanfare.  Seriously quiet.  I mean,
if you twist my arm, I might admit to doing enough of a victory dance that
my wife asked what the noise in my office was.  But other than that, nothing.
It was just a normal night, and the release was performed by following some
simple instructions and using this command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pipenv run python -m twine upload --config-file .pypirc --repository pypi dist/*
</pre></div>
<h2 id="and-the-work-goes-on">And The Work Goes On<a class="headerlink" href="#and-the-work-goes-on" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After taking a minute to appreciate what I had done, I got to work on finding
out if there were any small tasks in the release that I had missed.  The first
thing I did was bump the project version to <code>0.5.1</code>.  After that, I double
checked to make sure that the <code>setup.py</code> file contained the PyPi name of the
project, <code>pymarkdownlnt</code>, and committed that change.</p>
<p>Having passed my 48-hour documentation cool off period, I went through
each of the documentation files carefully and found a handful of small changes that
I felt needed to be made.  Except for adding the missing <code>advanced_plugins.md</code> file
to the repository, most of the remaining changes were simple wording changes
or organizational changes.</p>
<p>The main organizational change that I made were primarily made to provide
a brief summary for each section.  While I am not sure it is the right
approach, I decided to start each important section with a simple table
containing the important concepts from that section.  My goal with these tables
is to provide readers with a quick summary to help them decide if they
wanted to read that section.  I am not sure if I have the right information
or the right format yet, but I wanted to give it a try and see how it works
out.</p>
<p>The other organizational change I made was along the same lines as the summary
tables.  But instead of starting each section with a table, I decided to start
the <code>readme.md</code> file with some relevant badges.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-badges">What Are Badges?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-badges" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Badges (or shields) are an interesting concept that leverage visual information with
the advent of webservices.  A good example of this is the badge Markdown that
I use for displaying the version number associated with the package uploaded
to PyPi: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymarkdownlnt"><img alt="Version" src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pymarkdownlnt.svg"/></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">![Version</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">shields</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">io</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pypi</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pymarkdownlnt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">svg</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">]</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nl">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">pypi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">project</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pymarkdownlnt</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>The most important part of the badge is the badge image link, which is the Image
element specified inside of the Link’s label.  In this case, I
use the provider <code>img.shields.io</code> to provide a badge
displaying the version (the <code>/v</code>) from PyPi (the <code>/pypi</code>) for this project
(the <code>pymarkdownlnt</code>) in the SVG image format (the <code>.svg</code>).  This is all
that is required to display the above image with the version information.
Because nothing is hardcoded, when I upload a new version of the project to PyPi,
eventually <code>img.shields.io</code> will expire its cache and retrieve a new version.
When that happens, the badge image automatically updates.</p>
<p>The second part of the badge is the optional outer Link element.  While it is optional,
it is convenient in that it includes a link to something associated with the badge
itself.  In the above case, as the badge shows the version of the package on PyPi,
it made sense to include a link to the package page on PyPi.  For the badge that I
use to display the project’s license agreement (<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/LICENSE.txt"><img alt="License" src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/jackdewinter/pymarkdown.svg"/></a>), I specify the location of the <code>license.txt</code>
file in the project.  And for badges where there is no commonsense page
to go to, such as the Black version used to format the Python for the project
(<img alt="GitHub Pipenv locked dependency version (branch)" src="https://img.shields.io/github/pipenv/locked/dependency-version/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/black/master"/>), I just
provide the image with no link.</p>
<p>While I initially viewed badges as frivolous, I quickly decided that they are useful
for two things: quick links for me and quick information for others. Instead of
maintaining multiple project links in my browser’s toolbar, I can just go to the
project’s main page and reference them from there.  From the other people
perspective, I can hopefully provide information to anyone interested in the project
in a quick and easy to digest summary format.</p>
<h3 id="and-that-completed-the-work-on-version-051">And That Completed The Work on Version 0.5.1<a class="headerlink" href="#and-that-completed-the-work-on-version-051" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having cleaned up what I wanted to, I went ahead and packaged up the code and
documentation for the project and uploaded version 0.5.1 of the project
to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymarkdownlnt/0.5.1/">PyPi</a>.</p>
<p>I then started on one more thing that I wanted to get out of the way before
the initial release: a good solid CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="cicd-pipelines-with-github-actions">CI/CD Pipelines With Github Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#cicd-pipelines-with-github-actions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>For those who are not in the know, CI/CD pipelines are all the rage
these days, and with good reason.  The full name for them is Continuous Integration
and Continuous Deployment pipelines, which is a mouthful.  And technically,
while I want a pipeline in place before the initial release, it will only technically
be a Continuous Integration pipeline.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is simple: one is for integration, and one is
for deployment.  Before sending an email to me to let me know that I am responsible
for a facepalm that was just performed, let me explain: common sense isn’t always
common.  A lot of people that I know in the industry often get those two parts
of the pipeline or two different pipelines confused, so let me try and clarify
what I mean.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a>
is the part of the pipeline that most people implement and
takes care of updating the project’s main repository with the latest changes
submitted by developers.  Once submitted, those changes are subjected to various
checks and balances to ensure that those changes do not negatively affect the
project.  In the case of the pipeline that I am setting up, I am more concerned
about running extensive checks after I have finished my own subset of checks.
However, many pipelines are setup to mandate that all checks pass before any
changes are accepted into the repository.  As these checks happen with every
change submitted, and not on a schedule, they are considered continuous integrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment">Continuous Deployment</a> is
similar, but different.  For this example, in addition to the PyMarkdown linter,
assume that we also provide a simple webservice.  This webservice allows people
to submit Markdown documents, with the webservice reporting any standard violations
back to the submitter.  With that assumption in place, we can set up another
pipeline to trigger once the Continuous Integration pipeline produces a new artifact.
This new pipeline will probably then run extra checks to verify that the new
artifact works properly.
If those checks succeed, then the pipeline starts the process of deploying that
new artifact to the location where the webservice is being hosted.  Once again,
only if all the checks pass will the new webservice be deployed to the
specified environment.  So, while the concepts of integration and deployment are
different, the continuous prefix of both concepts are the same in that they
happen automatically once something is produced.</p>
<p>For this project, I do not have anything that I need to deploy, so I am just
implementing a CI pipeline.  For now, when I submit any changes, I want to
ensure that the formatting of the changes is correct, and I want to run the
full set of scenario
tests on all three common platforms.  I do not want to have to ask for these
to be kicked off, I want it to “just happen”.  And that is where GitHub Actions
comes into play.</p>
<h3 id="github-actions">GitHub Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#github-actions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While GitHub Actions have only been around for a short while, they have made
quite the splash in the software community.  As the main repository for the
PyMarkdown project is a GitHub repository, I can associate specific actions
with specific triggers that occur with the repository itself.</p>
<h4 id="setting-the-initial-context">Setting The Initial Context<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-the-initial-context" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is what I specified in the prefix of my <code>main.yml</code> file, located in the
<code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code> directory of the repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Main</span>

<span class="nt">on</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">push</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">pull_request</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">schedule</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">cron</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'0</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">0</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">*</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">*</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">*'</span>  <span class="c1"># daily</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Breaking it down, this workflow has a name <code>Main</code>, and will be executed if
one of three criteria are met: a push occurs, a pull request is created,
or the scheduled time occurs.  In this case, that scheduled time is 00:00,
or midnight server time.  It is important to note that this interpretation
of midnight is up to the server’s interpretation of midnight, not the viewer’s.</p>
<p>After that initial context was established, I started working on
the <code>jobs</code> section, which initially looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">jobs</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="nt">install-test</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">runs-on</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">ubuntu-latest</span>

    <span class="nt">steps</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">actions/checkout@v2</span> <span class="c1"># Checking out the repo</span>

    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Install dependecies</span>
      <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">VaultVulp/action-pipenv@v2.0.1</span>
      <span class="nt">with</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nt">command</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">install -d</span> <span class="c1"># Install all dependencies, including development ones</span>

    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Test</span>
      <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">VaultVulp/action-pipenv@v2.0.1</span>
      <span class="nt">with</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nt">command</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">run pytest</span> <span class="c1"># Run custom `pytest` command defined in the `[scripts]` block of Pipfile</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking around for something that worked with the project, I read the documentation
on the <code>VaultVulp/action-pipenv</code> action and thought it would work.  However,
after a few attempts, I wasn’t getting anywhere. I then moved on to the
<code>dschep/install-pipenv-action@v1</code> action:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">test-2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">runs-on</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span class="nt">steps</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">actions/checkout@master</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">actions/setup-python@v1</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">dschep/install-pipenv-action@v1</span>
    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pipenv run pytest</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and got some manner of response right away.  Thinking about that response,
I quickly changed the last line to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">run</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pipenv --help</span>
</pre></div>
<p>allowing me to make some progress.  I then realized that I had tried to jump right to
executing the tests instead of just verifying that <code>pipenv</code> was working
for the project.  By only executing <code>pipenv --help</code>, I was able to make sure
that Pipenv was working properly without worrying about any other component,
which was the right call for that point in time.  And while it wasn’t exactly
where I wanted to be, that simplified workflow worked right away.</p>
<p>Thinking things through with my use of <code>pipenv</code>, I figured out that
<code>pipenv run pytest</code> by itself was never going to work.  I needed to ensure
that <code>pipenv</code> sycned itself with the project before running the tests.  Therefore,
I changed those steps to reflect that, as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">test-2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nt">runs-on</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">ubuntu-latest</span>

<p>and it worked right away!  Before, I had tried to create a workflow
that jumped right to the last step, and it failed.  But now I was taking the
time to set <code>pipenv</code> up properly using <code>run: pipenv sync</code>.  I still took the
steps to run the test as before, but by inserting the <code>run: pipenv sync</code> line
into the workflow, I ensured that Pipenv synced itself up with the repository
and its <code>piplock</code> file. That helped a lot!</p>
<p>Also, it helped me to give each step a distinct name.  While different things
work for different people, having a good name for each step just helped me
identify with each step properly.  And seeing as I maintain this project,
that was important to me.</p>
<h4 id="adding-platform-support">Adding Platform Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-platform-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>I stated earlier in the article, my main goal for the pipeline was to run more
extensive tests than I can locally.  While I do have an Ubuntu subsystem on my
machine, I do not have any Apple subsystem that I can install for testing.
As such, I did some research and quickly ran into the GitHub Actions <code>strategy</code> item.
Looking like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nt">strategy</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="nt">matrix</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1">#python: [3.8, 3.9]</span>
        <span class="c1">#platform: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]</span>
        <span class="nt">python</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">3.8</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span>
        <span class="nt">platform</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">windows-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span>
    <span class="nt">runs-on</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">${{ matrix.platform }}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>the strategy section replaces the <code>runs-on: ubuntu-latest</code> line in the
previous examples.  The power of this construct is that it allows me to
specify multiple platforms and Python versions to test on, which is
exactly what I wanted to do: more extensive testing.</p>
<h4 id="code-coverage">Code Coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#code-coverage" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>I could have focused on more extensive testing at this stage, but I decided to
focus on duplicating the existing tests on my local development environment.
At that moment, I was more interested
in demonstrating the code coverage for the project rather than the project
running on multiple platforms.  After doing some research on
<a href="codecov.io">CodeCov</a>, I created a new account on their site and added this
code to the workflow file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Report Coverage</span>
      <span class="nt">uses</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">codecov/codecov-action@v1</span>
      <span class="nt">if</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">github.event_name != 'schedule'</span>
      <span class="nt">with</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nt">file</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">./report/coverage.xml</span>
        <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">${{ matrix.python }} - ${{ matrix.platform }}</span>
        <span class="nt">fail_ci_if_error</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">true</span> 
</pre></div>
<p>After adding an environment secret to the project, the coverage information
was relayed to CodeCov when I ran the workflow.  It was then available for
examinination on the project’s page at
<a href="https://codecov.io/gh/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">codecov.io</a>, and soon after that
information appeared in a new badge for code coverage that I added.
While I got a lot of
benefit for a relatively small amount of work, it was due to my ongoing measurement
of code coverage that this was so easy.  But a win is a win, so I took it.</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-documentation">Cleaning Up Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-up-documentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that I was getting tangibly close to releasing, I wanted to start tracking
changes properly.  As such, when I noticed that every example in the project
documentation was using <code>python main.py</code> instead of <code>pymarkdown</code>, I knew it
was a good time to start.  So, I created
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/3">Issue 3</a>
to track that project work needed to make the change.  While the change
was small, it was a habit that I needed to get in to.</p>
<h2 id="adding-lint-support">Adding Lint Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-lint-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before circling back and adding extra platforms to the workflow, there was
one last thing that I needed to add: Lint Support.  Literally cutting and
pasting from the other job in the workflow and my <code>clean.cmd</code> script, I
quickly came up with this job:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="nt">lint</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Since linting should work equally well on any given platform, I simply picked
the Windows platform to run this job on.  Then, using my <code>clean.cmd</code> script as
a guide, I created new steps after the <code>run: pipenv sync</code> step to execute
the lint commands the exact same way that I execute those commands in my script.</p>
<p>While it doesn’t happen that often, I was able to get that new job up and running
with only one try.  I appreciate that it was due to previous debugging sessions,
but I was still grateful.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-the-linux-tests">Figuring Out The Linux Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#figuring-out-the-linux-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After having left the Linux tests turned off from the night before, on Thursday night
I was eager to get them those tests working.  Enabling the Linux tests was
as simple as adding the <code>ubuntu-latest</code> tag to the <code>platform</code> configuration
for the tests:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nt">platform</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">windows-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">,</span> <span class="nv">ubuntu-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and committing it to the repository.  That is when the fun began!</p>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/4">Issue 4</a>
to track the Linux build issues and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/5">Issue 5</a>
to track the MacOs build issues.  These issues didn’t have to have
tons of documentation, just some information that would help me figure
out what to do.</p>
<p>Thinking that it would be an easy fix, I looked at the output and
determined that it was a problem with the temporary files that I use
in the tests.  To ensure that configuration options are tested properly,
for any scenario tests that require it, I create
a temporary file with the configuration dictionary serialized to the file and
pass the path to that
temporary file into PyMarkdown using the <code>--config</code> command line setting.
But for some reason it wasn’t working.</p>
<p>At first, it reported a problem with the <code>delete=False</code> parameter that
was passed into the <code>TemporaryFile</code> function but removing that parameter
didn’t fix the problem.  So then I added <code>--log-level DEBUG</code> to the arguments for one
of the tests, but I didn’t see any immediate difference.  After four
more <code>debug</code> commits, I still wasn’t any closer to getting any information
that would help me figure things out.</p>
<p>I figured out that the only way I was going to figure out the issue properly
was to install the Ubuntu subsystem on my machine.  Without that, I was going
to be guessing and guessing, with not much progress.  After setting up
the install for the Ubuntu subsystem, I decided it was time that I retired
for the night.  I had no idea what I was in store for next.</p>
<h3 id="serendipity-strikes">Serendipity Strikes<a class="headerlink" href="#serendipity-strikes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having some family commitments to attend to, I was out of the house for about
24 hours from Friday to Saturday. When I got home, I was shocked.  My system
had died.  It really died.  After three or four hours of doing updates and resets
and such, I was very convinced that it had died to the extent that it would take a
complete re-install of the operating system to get things back in working order.
It was deflating.</p>
<p>But I had an option.  My son is very hardware oriented, and before this year’s
computer chip scarcity started, he built himself a new system from scratch.  To
help him on his journey and get a newer system in the process, I purchased his
old system from him.  My current system was at least six years old and purchased from
Fry’s, whereas his older system was around three years old and
made from scratch for his gaming needs.  It was going to be a clear upgrade.</p>
<p>The issue?  Time.  Between my various hobbies, yardwork, professional work,
and the PyMarkdown project, I had never found the required time to get his
older system set up.  Now that my system died, I had a great forcing function
for me to get it set up and fast.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I back most of what I need up to a backup server, and I was able
to retain almost everything that I thought I might have lost.  Installing
the new operating system on the older machine was a lot easier than I remembered
it being, and it was quickly completed.  Going through a list of programs
that I needed took a bit, but by focusing on it, I made quick progress of it.
Once that was done, I started getting my GitHub repositories cloned to my
new system, and I was back in business.</p>
<p>Painful, but worth it.  The new system is clean, uncluttered, and fast.</p>
<h3 id="getting-back-to-work">Getting Back To Work<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-back-to-work" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After sleeping in Sunday morning (after setting up the system until sometime in
the early morning), I started to work on the Linux test issue in my system’s
Ubuntu subsystem.  I had
installed Python, Git, and everything else the night before, so it was just
a matter of working things out from my usual baseline.</p>
<p>With everything in place, I was able to quickly diagnose what the problem was.  In my
haste to get things working, I had created temporary files on my Windows
system using the <code>TemporaryFile</code> Python function.  While it worked fine on
my Windows machine, it was not working at all on my Ubuntu subsystem.  After
a bit of research, I determined that I needed to change that function to the
<code>NamedTemporaryFile</code> function and add the <code>delete=False</code> parameter back to
the call to that function.  After removing the <code>print</code> debug statements that
I had previously added, that one change alone brough the number of failing
tests from 70 down to 5 in a matter of minutes.  After more than three days
of trying to figure it out, it was solved, and it felt good.</p>
<p>The next three issues were also easy to fix.  When I wrote the tests
that handled the <code>entities.json</code> file testing, I erroneously used simple
string concatenation to determine the path names.  Now that I was dealing
with more than one operating system, that practice fell apart.  Replacing those
concatenations with calls to <code>os.path.join</code> and doing some extra testing,
I was able to put that issue to bed.  With a reminder to myself to not
shortcut code that deals with operating systems and their artifacts, it
was on to the next set of tests.</p>
<p>There were only two stubborn tests left.  Looking at the output, those test
failures appeared to be simple ordering issues.  When the <code>pymarkdown plugins list</code>
command was submitted on the Linux systems, the order in which the plugins
were reported back seemed arbitrary.  To fix that, I simply replaced:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">next_plugin_id</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all_plugin_ids</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>with the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all_plugin_ids</span>
    <span class="n">ids</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sort</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">next_plugin_id</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">ids</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to sort the list before using it, and I was then down to zero failures.
After ensuring that everything was working properly for both Windows and
Ubuntu environments, I ran my script to clean up the code and committed
those changes.  A few anxious minutes later, and all the GithubAction
jobs completed successfully!</p>
<h2 id="and-then-issue-5">And Then… Issue 5<a class="headerlink" href="#and-then-issue-5" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>And after all that work to get tests running on Linux machines,
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/5">Issue 5</a>
was addressed by simply including the <code>macos-latest</code> platform:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="nt">platform</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p p-Indicator">[</span><span class="nv">windows-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">,</span> <span class="nv">ubuntu-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">,</span> <span class="nv">macos-latest</span><span class="p p-Indicator">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I fully expected something to happen, but nothing did.  After
everything it took to get to that point, it was a nice change.</p>
<h2 id="and-finally-the-initial-release">And Finally… The Initial Release<a class="headerlink" href="#and-finally-the-initial-release" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>And with as much fanfare as the release of PyMarkdown <code>0.5.0</code>, the
initial release of PyMarkdown <code>0.8.0</code> was released.  All scenario
tests are passing on all platforms.  The entire project is being
linted and everything looks fine.  It just feels right.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a long time getting to this point, but I was now here.  I
have a project that I can be proud of that I believe has been architected,
designed, and implemented properly.  It has a healthy set of scenario tests
and unit tests, and it follows known coding practices.  More than that,
I gave myself the time to do things properly instead of rushing ahead,
even when my instinct was to do just that.</p>
<p>With the initial release taken care of, I know I have some issues to take
care of before I start adding new features, but I feel okay about that.
I have a good set of things that I know I must look at, and a great set
of tests that will make sure that any changes I make don’t break anything else.
Basically, because I took my time to do things “right”, I have the utmost
confidence that I can quickly deal with most of the issues in the Issues List.</p>
<p>And because of what I have learned getting to this point, the experience has
been priceless.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To be honest, I am not sure.  I still need to work on the project,
but I am not sure if I should get some utility stuff dealt with or
focus on the project before moving forward.  Stay tuned!</p>
