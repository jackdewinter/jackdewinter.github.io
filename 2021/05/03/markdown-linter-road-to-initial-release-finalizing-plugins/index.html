<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/04/19/markdown-linter-road-to-initial-release-gearing-up-for-plugins/">last article</a>, I talked about
gearing up for the work that I need to do on the plugins to get them ready for the release.
In this article, I do that work to get the already implemented plugins ready for the release.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Getting close to being ready for the initial release, the list of things left to clean
up was down to the actual focus of the project: the plugin rules.  Without a healthy
set of rules to power it,
a linter is usually either a fancy parser engine that is not being used to its fullest
or some Regular Expression test cases that have not been tested properly.  While the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown project</a>
was definitely not just a fancy parser, I needed to upgrade the initial set of thirteen
rules to make sure that was not the case.</p>
<p>Hoping to make a quick couple days work of upgrades, I started working on the plugin rules.</p>

<h2 id="before-i-start">Before I Start<a class="headerlink" href="#before-i-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Apologies to any faithful readers that I did not post an article last week.  I was
recovering from my second COVID-19 shot and was out of commission from about 6PM on
Saturday evening until about 6pm on Tuesday evening.  I was able to do minimal
amounts of work during that time frame, but I felt like I was constantly trying
to push through a tough wall of fog.  And after two days of trying to push through
that fog, I decided to stop all work, including waiting a week before posting an article.
I was having issues with the quality of my own coding work at that time, and it was
only through rigorous testing and linting that I was successful there.  From a
writing an article point of view, I decided that I would rather wait a week and rest
than produce something that was not up to par with my usual posts.</p>
<p>Was it worth it?  Yes… unequivocally yes!  From a personal viewpoint, I know quite
a few people that have either had a severe case of COVID and required hospitalization
and even a couple of people that have had a good friend pass away from COVID and
its complications.  My personal choice is to deal with the side effects of the shots
and know I am more protected than before, thereby reducing some of my anxiety from
this unusual time we are all in.</p>
<p>To any readers out there:  Please make an informed choice as to whether you
get vaccinated.  It is not only your health that you need to worry about,
but the health of those around you and to possibility of mutations in COVID.  Do not
just brush off any decision.  Read the information from the CDC, read information
from reputable sources about what can happen to you and your local groups with
and without the vaccines, and make an educated decision.</p>
<p>And now, on to the rest of the article.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-start">Where To Start?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-to-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>To complete this task, I needed to verify and update each of the 13 plugin rules
that have previously been coded, ensuring that they still work and are tested
properly.  I was aware that some of those rules were going to need no changes
at all, but I was also aware that some may need some decent refactoring to keep
up with the changes that have occurred since they were coded.  I had guesses
which rules were going to fall into which category, but I just needed to start
working on them to really get an idea of what changes needed to occur.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-three-rules">The First Three Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-first-three-rules" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Examining
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_001.py">Rule md001</a>,
everything looked fine with this rule except for its lack of support for
front-matter.  Since I execute this rule against my blog posts which contain
front-matter,
this rule fires on each article due to my use of that front-matter to specify metadata
about the article.  So, after adding three new scenario tests that include various
forms of metadata, I started to make the changes to this rule.</p>
<p>Setting the new <code>__front_matter_title</code> field to <code>title</code>, it was surprisingly easy
to add support for the Front Matter token to the <code>next_token</code> function.  As
the Front Matter token only appears once at the start of the document, the
code was very simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_front_matter</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__front_matter_title</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">matter_map</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">hash_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, if that token is present, check for the actual title in the map,
setting the <code>hash_count</code> variable to <code>1</code> if it is present.  At that point,
the rest of the code takes control of any following Atx Heading tokens or
SetExt Heading tokens as they occur.</p>
<p>But while everything looked good, the tests were not passing.  As I started
debugging, it looked like I needed to do some finessing with the
<code>front_matter_markdown_token.py</code> module.  In checking the source code
against what tokens were being produced, there were two small issues that
I needed to take care of.</p>
<p>The first change I needed to do was to add the call to the <code>lower</code> function
to this line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">value_map</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">current_title</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">()]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">current_value</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because I want to do a simple lookup inside of the <code>value_map</code> dictionary,
I want to get the <code>current_title</code> to a standardized form.  If I do not do that, I would
have to try an increasingly large combination of forms, such as <code>Title</code>,
<code>title</code>, <code>TiTle</code>, <code>tItLe</code> and so on.  By standardizing on that single form,
I keep the number of lookups required to a single lookup.  Hence,
I appended the <code>.lower()</code> to that variable when using it as a key in the
dictionary, standardizing on a lowercase metadata name.</p>
<p>The other issue was a similar issue to the issue of standardized lookup
name, but with a standardized form of the data stored for that name.  If
possible, any lookup of a value from the dictionary should be usable
without any modifications being needed.  But the way the data currently
was, any leading or trailing whitespace was being added to the
<code>current_value</code> variable along with the rest of the data.  To me, it made
more sense to take the same care with the front-matter values.  To that
extent, I made sure to add a call to the <code>strip</code> built-in function before
adding the string to the <code>current_value</code> variable.  While it was not
perfect, I was pretty sure it would handle a good 80% of the scenarios
I already had in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, to round things out, I added some extra configuration to fetch a
configurable string to use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize_from_config</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__front_matter_title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plugin_configuration</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_string_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"front_matter_title"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"title"</span>
        <span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lower</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<h3 id="the-other-two-rules">The Other Two Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-other-two-rules" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_002.py">Rule md002</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_003.py">Rule md003</a>
are very narrowly focused, they did not require any changes to the source code or the test code.
I did play around with (or experiment with if you prefer) various combinations to try and find some gaps in both
rules for about an hour or so each.  But in both cases, any failures that I found boiled
down to one of the already existing scenarios already being tested in the scenario tests.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-march">The Long March<a class="headerlink" href="#the-long-march" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yup, 13 days occurred between the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/b2c8207cd596b93c4a0423ca10a5b92a9a4d503f">last commit</a>
before this change and the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/4e09a5bb480b852436a452f63fdd21d2e1a00493">current commit</a>
that included this change.  Like a fair number of previous difficult tasks, I tried to
be smart about it, and ended up choosing what I believe to be the simplest
solution.</p>
<h3 id="the-research">The Research<a class="headerlink" href="#the-research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning, I added 17 new scenario tests to deal with Block Quote elements,
List elements, and inline elements.  Right away, there were over ten test failures
and a handful of cases that threw an exception when the rule was executed.  At that
point, this was part of the code in the <code>next_token</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_text</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_paragraph_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">split_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_paragraph_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The exceptions were occurring due to the <code>assert</code> statement failing.  It was not
failing on all tests, just ones that had multiple Text tokens within
the bounds of the Heading tokens that spanned multiple lines.  As soon as that
<code>assert</code> statement was hit in those cases, the <code>assert</code> would trigger, and
rightly so.  In those cases, only part of the required newlines were attributed
and stored with that first Text token, the rest of the newlines being stored
in the various tokens where the newline occurred.  And as soon as that first
Text token was hit, that <code>assert</code> statement evaluates to <code>False</code> and the
rule fails.</p>
<h3 id="lather-rinse-repeat">Lather, Rinse, Repeat<a class="headerlink" href="#lather-rinse-repeat" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once again, I started out with the best of intentions and wanted to
come up with a solution that was very workable and very smart.  I have
talked about this before in my articles, and I am pretty sure that I will
talk about it in future articles.  I do not purposefully do it, nor is it
a matter of pride or a matter of proving myself to someone.  As part of
my nature, I want to keep quality and performance at a high level, so I
strive to come up with the best solution that maximizes those concepts.
And, I also admit, I sometimes get carried away.</p>
<p>So, with the best of intentions, I tried four different variations on
a theme, each one trying to solve the issue in a slightly different
manner.  One incarnation tried to keep every token that occurred in a
Python list, only to try and parse through it later.  Another incarnation
tried to be smarter about handling Link tokens but did not pay enough
focus to the other types of tokens.  It was just a lot of effort with
things getting close to proper solution before falling apart.  And
with each incarnation of the solution, I got more frustrated until
I had enough.</p>
<p>It was then that I decided to take a step back and think things through
more clearly.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-mistakes">Learning From Mistakes<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-from-mistakes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>There were a couple of things that I learned from all those iterations,
painful as they were to remember.  The big thing that I was once again
looking at was that complicated solutions were just tripping over
themselves.  I would set a value here, access it there, and then when
I went to reference it in another piece of the source code, I was
surprised that its value had changed.  I did not need to have complicated
variables to hold the information I needed, I just needed to have
“just enough” information.</p>
<p>Only a small distance away from that concept, I needed to keep my
solutions small enough to hold “just enough” information to complete the
task.  Of the four solutions that I tried in that week, three of them
tried to keep everything that occurred within the Paragraph element
in a list to be analyzed later.  It was just crazy the things I was
trying to do to keep that data in sync with the tokens as the
information came through.</p>
<p>I needed to take the best of what worked and learn from what did not.
And I had a feeling that it would be a simple solution that I had
missed.  And I was right.</p>
<h3 id="final-solution">Final Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#final-solution" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>When I sat back and looked at what I tried and what worked and
what did not work, the easy part that worked was the handling of
the Text token itself and not referencing Text tokens within an
inline Link element.  To cleanly take care of that, I replaced
this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_text</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_paragraph_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>with the slightly more complicated:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_paragraph_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__inside_of_link</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_text</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Essentially, ignore any tokens inside of a Link token until the rule is looking
outside of that Link token’s scope.  Once that was done, I was able
to continue with the processing of Text tokens within a Paragraph
token with the following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">split_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>

</pre></div>
<p>While it looks like it is a lot more complicated than the previous two lines
that it replaces, those two <code>if</code> statements are there
solely to ensure that the column number is calculated properly.  From that point
of view, I think it was a good win! And when I said above that I needed the
algorithm and variables to have “just enough” information, I believe I am
meeting the constraint here.  The <code>__paragraph_index</code> variable is the only
thing that was added to the main part of the changed code, as that was the
only thing required to ensure that the right part of the Paragraph token’s
leading space field was being used.  The other fields that are present in
the code do not try and reconstruct the data, just report on what the algorithm
encountered.</p>
<p>With that main part of the solution in place, there were no more exceptions
being thrown as the <code>assert</code> statement had been removed.  From my work
with the consistency checks for the tokens, I was confident that everything
lined up with respect to the newlines in tokens, I just had to keep track
of them in this rule.  So, I added code that only tracked those changes,
and nothing else:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>The two exceptions to that statement were the Hard Line Break token and
the Link token.  As I mentioned previously, to deal with Link elememts
properly, I needed to keep track of when the rule was looking at tokens
within the scope of a Link token, hence <code>self.__inside_of_link</code>.  In a
similar vein, as I had decided that any inline element on a line would
invalidate that line from this rule, I needed to track the presence
of that token, hence <code>self.__first_line_after_hard_break</code>.</p>
<p>I believe that the thing that made the above code work well was that
I was primarily only tracking the one thing that I needed to: the
<code>__paragraph_index</code> field.  I did not have to try and reconstitute anything
to figure that out, I just had to count newline characters.  And to
be honest, I think I might work on refactoring that out in the future
as well.</p>
<p>Finally, adding in some initialization code when a Paragraph token was encountered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__paragraph_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_line_after_other_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_line_after_hard_break</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__inside_of_link</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__paragraph_column_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">column_number</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and some code to handle the end of a line within a Text token:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_line_after_other_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__first_line_after_hard_break</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__paragraph_index</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and I was done.  Of course, it took a bit longer to actually arrive at
that solution, but not much more.  I focused on one small set of
scenario tests and worked to get those passing before moving on to
another set of tests.  If my notes are accurate, I started with plain
Text tokens, then multiple line Text tokens, then Text tokens with
various forms of Code Span tokens scattered around the Text tokens,
and then on to the other inline tokens.</p>
<h3 id="rule-md019">Rule md019<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md019" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After all that work, it was nice to check out
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_019.py">Rule md019</a>.
Like Rule md002 and Rule md003 above, the constrained and focused
nature of this rule led to it being just fine as it was.  No changes required.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-four-rules">The Next Four Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#the-next-four-rules" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After taking a long time to get Rule md018 finished, it was with some trepidation that
I started to work on Rule md020.  I was not sure if it was going to be as bad as the previous
rule, but I had to push forward anyways.  </p>
<h3 id="rule-md020">Rule Md020<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md020" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting on
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_020.py">Rule md020</a>,
I copied over 21 new scenario tests
from the scenario tests for Rule Md 018, modifying them to test for possible Atx Closed
Heading elements instead of Atx Heading elements.  After the modifications were made,
I carefully determined what the correct output for each of the new scenario tests was,
and coded that in.</p>
<p>Trying to leverage the work that I did in modifying the code for Rule Md018, I looked
at the code, determined to refactor it.  To that extent, I took a bulk of the code from
the <code>RuleMd018</code> class and moved it into the <code>StartOfLineTokenParser</code> class.  In place of
the conditional that determines if the <code>report_next_token_error</code> function should be
called, I created a new <code>check_start_of_line</code> function and made it do nothing.  Then
I implemented a new <code>MyStartOfLineTokenParser</code> class, and moved the two conditionals
from the original <code>RuleMd018</code> class into the <code>check_start_of_line</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyStartOfLineTokenParser</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">StartOfLineTokenParser</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">owner</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__owner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">owner</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">check_start_of_line</span><span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">"^\s{0,3}#{1,6}\S"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">combined_text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">"#\s*$"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">combined_text</span>
        <span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__owner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="n">line_number_delta</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">line_number_delta</span><span class="p">,</span>
                <span class="n">column_number_delta</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">column_number_delta</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then, in the <code>RuleMd018</code> class, after creating a new instance of the
<code>MyStartOfLineTokenParser</code> class in the <code>__init__</code> function, the wiring
up of the calls to that instance was simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">starting_new_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__token_parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">starting_new_file</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__token_parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With that refactor accomplished and tested, it was then on to the
actual rule that I wanted to work on, Rule md020.  Reusing the
<code>StartOfLineTokenParser</code> class, I created another <code>MyStartOfLineTokenParser</code> class
in the <code>rule_md_020.py</code> module.  The only change that was required  to support
the new rule was to replace the conditional in the <code>check_start_of_line</code> function
with the follow conditional:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s2">"^\s{0,3}#{1,6}.*#+\s*$"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">combined_text</span><span class="p">):</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because I took the time to do a solid refactor of Rule md020, reusing
the <code>MyStartOfLineTokenParser</code> class in this rule was a smart move.  Things just
worked with little effort.  A definite plus!</p>
<h3 id="rule-md021-md022-and-md023">Rule Md021, Md022 and Md023<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md021-md022-and-md023" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While it was not as much work as Rule md018, Rule md020 did take a bit of work to get
done.  Looking at
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_021.py">Rule md021</a>,
I knew that was not going to be the case.  Similar to code
for Rule md019, the code for that rule was very simple and straightforward.  As such,
no changes were required in either the rule code or the test code.</p>
<p>Taking a quick look at the source code for
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_022.py">Rule md022</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_023.py">Rule md023</a>,
 my hope
was that they were
was that they did not need any changes.  In both cases, the code seemed to be very narrowly
confined to working on existing Heading tokens and the text contained within
those headings.  Looking at the issues list, I addressed concerns about these
two rules by extra tests for Block Quote
elements and List elements for both rules, as well as extra line spacing tests
for Rule md022.</p>
<p>After that research and executing the scenario tests, that initial observation
on the simplicity of these rules was confirmed.  With the simple addition of some
extra scenario tests, I was satisfied that the scenarios were adequately covered.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-four">The Final Four<a class="headerlink" href="#the-final-four" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Proceeding on to
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_024.py">Rule md024</a>,
the code itself was solid and did not require any changes.  However, to ensure things
were properly tested, I added 6 new scenario tests for the rule.  As testing support for
rules within Block Quote elements and List elements has been lacking for some of
the previous rules, I made sure to add tests for different forms of those elements.
In addition, as this rule deals with two headings have the same text, I added extra
tests to verify that adding a single space or an inline element (such as adding
emphasis) is enough to make the headings not equal.</p>
<p>Looking at
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_026.py">Rule md026</a>,
the code was bulky and needed a bit of refactoring, but the code itself was solid.
As this rule deals with the content of Atx Heading tokens and SetExt tokens, there
was no need to check out any weird conditions.  Doing my due diligence, I ran
through some experimental tests to see if I missed anything.  Everything that I threw
at the rule emitted the data that I expected without fail, including the line number
and column number.  After checking to make sure that some form of each experimental test
was present in the scenario tests, it was on to the next rule.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous two rules,
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_036.py">Rule md036</a>
did not require any changes to the code as it deals with a focused examination
of emphasized text within a Paragraph element.  And as with the scenario tests for
previous rules, some quick experimental testing did not reveal anything that
had been missed with those scenario tests outside of containing them within
Block Quote elements and List elements.  Those two scenario tests were easily
added and worked without any changes, so it was on to the last rule.</p>
<p>To say that ending up with
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/pymarkdown/plugins/rule_md_047.py">Rule md047</a>
was anticlimactic would be an understatement.  This rule has one and only one very
narrowly defined condition as part of its rule: does the document end with a blank line.
Let me just say that it took less than 10 minutes to verify the code was working
as desired and the scenario tests were covering everything properly.  Yup,
that easy.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Well, the first thing that I need to confess to my readers is that I did not listen
to my own advice.  I want to release this project so much that I pushed ahead with
coding work on the rules even though I knew I was having issues with the quality
of that work. And to be honest, I ended up paying for it with headaches and
having to reexamine the code that I had already completed to make sure that I did not
mess anything up.  Hopefully one of these days I will learn to not push
ahead so much.</p>
<p>As to the couple of days that I had hoped to take to get the rules into shape,
that did not happen.  It is okay that it did not happen, the work took as long
as it needed to take to get to a solution that I am confident about.  Sure,
I would love to get some of that week back that I lost working on Rule md018,
but it happened.  Most of the rules took a decent one to two hours to
properly inspect and fix, and I am okay with that.  It is the level of confidence
that I have in shipping an initial release with those rules that I am
concerned with.</p>
<p>To that end, I think I am doing very well.  I made some notes about things to
check in the rules, like I always do.  But I am certain that anything
that I find will be a small issue, not a big issue link Rule md018.  I am
also certain that when I start documenting the various rules for the initial
release, I will find at least a couple of inconsistencies that I will need
to look at.  Never a dull moment!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With each plugin rule examined and working properly, I needed to get back to
my proper coding mindset and make sure that each rule was passing all quality
bars and each rule was properly documented.  Stay tuned!</p>
