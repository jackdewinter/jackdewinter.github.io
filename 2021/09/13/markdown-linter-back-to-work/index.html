<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/08/30/markdown-linter-another-three-done/">last article</a>, I talked
about the work I put into getting that weeks’ three rules completed. In this article, I
talk about the next three rules I worked on.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wow! It has been an interesting two weeks since my last article.  With a
ton of things going on in both my professional life and my personal life,
I really have not had any time to work on the PyMarkdown project.  There
was not even enough time left over for me to write words, let alone code.
Both take brain cells
and creativity, and after about a week and a half of long days, I did not
feel that I possessed either of them.</p>
<p>With most of those efforts out of the way, I was able to start the
task of getting back to work on the project.  I knew that it was going to
take some effort to get my “project-muscles” back, but it was something
I was eager to do.  And what a better way to flex those muscles back into
shape than to complete the work on Rule Md043.</p>

<h2 id="rule-md043-completing-glob-matches">Rule Md043 - Completing Glob Matches<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md043-completing-glob-matches" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Getting started again after a couple of long weeks was no easy task.
Before I got busy with life, I had started to work on completing the
work to properly handle the recursive code for matching lines.  As I
mentioned
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/08/30/markdown-linter-another-three-done/#life-often-shows-up-when-you-least-expect-it">in my last article</a>,
I just ran out of time to figure it out for that week.  Now, facing
the daunting task of getting back to work, it sounded to me like a
good task to start with.</p>
<p>To refresh my context on that rule, I took quick inventory on where
I left things.  I soon figured out that before I stopped working on Rule Md043,
I had taken care of all the simple scenarios in which wildcards can
be used in globs.  The simple cases of <code>a</code>, <code>a*</code>, <code>*a</code>, and <code>a*b</code>
were all covered, with a gaping hole in the code where patterns with
multiple wildcards should be.  Repetitive wildcard cases such as <code>a*b*c</code> were
not being handled at all, and that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>To be clear, while I am pretty sure that most people will not create
monster matches like <code>a*b*c*b*c*b*c*d</code>, or any terribly recursive
combination.  However, I know I still needed to be able to support them.  And depending
on what the needs are, I can actually see some simple patterns for
document headers and document footers requiring at least two or three
wildcards.  It was time to deal with that!</p>
<h3 id="design">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Breaking it down from a design viewpoint, when the algorithm
arrived at the recursive section of the glob, the header and footer
of the glob had already been stripped away.  This means that if
the glob was <code>a*b*c</code>, what needed to be addressed was the remaining
pattern <code>*b*</code>.  Scribbling out different scenarios on paper, this made
it easy for me to see how other matches would work, as the difference
between <code>*b*</code> and <code>*b*d*</code> appeared to be an extra level of matching after
the first wildcard.</p>
<p>While I am not a stranger to both recursive and iterative algorithms,
I have enough experience to know that both algorithms can run away
on the user if they are not coded properly.  The difference is
that recursive algorithms tend to fail with out of memory errors,
which looks worse to the user than a bad index error.  At least
when I am using other software, that is my opinion.  So, knowing
that, if I chose a recursive algorithm, I wanted to make doubly
sure that the recursion was solid before shipping it.</p>
<h4 id="breaking-it-down">Breaking It Down<a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-it-down" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>In this case, I chose a recursive algorithm as the way to go.
As the difference between <code>*b*</code> and <code>*b*d*</code> is just another level,
the most efficient way to take care of that is with recursive
functions.  With that decision done, it was on to figuring out
how to do the matching and when to do the recursion.</p>
<p>Taking each part in stride took a bit for me to accomplish,
wanting to design everything at once.  But once I calmed down
a bit, I realized that the algorithm was simple.  With the
previous header and footer trimmed from the match, the first
thing the algorithm had to do was to find the next matches
for the first block of non-wildcard matches.  In the above
examples, this meant looking for a block of length one that
matched <code>b</code>. In the first match, once any one line was found
that matched that, everything was done, and it could return.
But in the second match, the algorithm then had to trim the
variables and recurse into the algorithm to find <code>*d*</code> within
the remaining data.  Once again, if there was any line that
matched <code>d</code>, the match was complete.</p>
<p>To be honest, I went through a handful of sheets of paper
going through weird combinations of data, making sure that
my design worked on paper.  In each case, I was careful
to adjust the current parameters before mentally “recursing”,
and that was something that I was going to must be
careful with.  But after taking three hours over two days
to make sure I had the design nailed down, it was time to
see if I got it right.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I already had a few scenario tests for multiple wildcards in the
project, but I added a new one to make sure I had things covered.
From using globs on file names for years, I had a good idea
of the patterns to test, and I was confident that I had the
right scenarios to test against.</p>
<p>Going to the code, the first thing I needed was to hook in the
new function to the <code>completed_file</code> function, invoking it when
there were multiple wildcard characters.  This meant replacing
this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">remaining_tokens</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="n">extra_error_information</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"More than one wildcard not supported."</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>
<p>with this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">recurse_result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__do_recursive</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">remaining_headings</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">top_heading_index</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">remaining_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">top_token_index</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">recurse_result</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">remaining_tokens</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span>
            <span class="n">extra_error_information</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"Multiple wildcard matching failed."</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That was where the fun began.  The <code>__do_recursive</code> function itself
does not have that many statements, but each statement has a lot of
functionality built into it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__do_recursive</span><span class="p">(</span>

<p>As was mentioned in the design section, the first part of the algorithm
is setting up for the search.  Thankfully, the <code>__verify_group_heading_match</code>
function already looks for a block of matching headings, so a call to
that function was pivotal to figuring out if a match is found.  If it is
found and the end index is not at the end of the <code>__compiled_heading</code>
variable, it means that the algorithm ran out of headings to match,
resulting in no matches.  If the end index is valid and equal to the
current “bottom”, then the algorithm is done with a found match.  However,
if it is not at the bottom, that means there are more wildcards to
process, so the algorithm recurses.</p>
<p>From my experience, most recursive algorithms are simple in their nature,
but the fact that they refer to themselves causes me some unease.
It just means that I have to be extra careful about everything in that
function as I am using it multiple times with variations on the same
data.   This was no different.  The algorithm at its core was simple.
Find a block of matching lines.  If there is more to look for, set
things up and find a more condensed block of matching lines.  If at
any point it fails, return right away.</p>
<p>But I still tested it extra carefully.  Let me just say that I have
been hit by recursive algorithms not being tested properly enough to
give them some extra respect when testing.  But after going through
and testing a handful of additional scenarios, they all matched
or did not match according to plan.  After some simple cleanup,
I checked in the code and moved on.</p>

<p>Looking through the remaining rules, a pair of them stood out from the rest:
Rule Md029 and Rule Md030.  To be honest, I thought I had completed them during
a previous pass at the rules.  But there it was in black and white, they still
needed to be completed.</p>
<p>For no other reason that it was first, I decided to start with Rule Md029 regarding
the style of Ordered List elements.  This rule has a simple principle behind it: keep things
consistent.   Most Markdown parsers do not like it when an author starts an Ordered
List Item with a seemingly random number.  Those parsers prefer to have those numbers
be all 1s or be a simple increasing number starting with 1.  Anything outside of
those two options mean that the parser decided what to do with it.  And that choice
does not always make sense.</p>
<h3 id="design_1">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Looking at the configuration settings, there were three classes of starting numbers
that I needed to look for: <code>all zeroes</code>, <code>all ones</code>, or <code>ordered</code> and starting from one.
Basically, <code>0/0/0</code>, <code>1/1/1</code>, and <code>1/2/3</code>.  There was the <code>0/1/2</code> variant of the
ordered, starting at <code>0</code> instead of <code>1</code>, but that was just an alternate starting
number.  The interesting variant was the <code>one or ordered</code> variant.  Allowing for
either the <code>1/1/1</code> class or the <code>1/2/3</code> class, it would be interesting to work
around that.</p>
<p>But after looking at all those classes and their variants, the design rapidly
became clear to me.  For every case other than the <code>one or ordered</code> variant,
everything was clear and spelled out by the first number.  Even differentiating
between the 0-based ordering and the 1-based ordering was easily dealt with using
just that first number.  The rest of the cases were just following the lead of
that first number.</p>
<p>For the one-or-ordered variant, I knew that most of the time the algorithm
would need to wait until the second number to figure out which class to put
the numbers in.  If the first number was <code>1</code>, then the list was still eligible
for both the <code>all ones</code> class and the <code>ordered class</code>.  But by the time the
second number came around, the algorithm would be locked in, or the algorithm
would trigger due to a bad number.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation_1">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Nailing down the scenario tests for the rule was easy.  There are four basic positive
sequences that were easy to define.  After doing some scribbling, I was able to
determine that the negative cases boiled down to three scenario tests.  I owe a lot of
that small test size due to the positive tests performing double duty as positive
tests for their own setting and negative tests for the other settings.</p>
<p>The actual code was a variation on algorithms I have written for other rules
dealing with container elements.  Not needing to deal with Block Quote elements, I just wrote
code to maintain a List element stack, with a second stack for the selected
configuration.</p>

<p>As the configuration may be in flux, it can also vary between a list and
any sublists.  Therefore, the <code>__ordered_list_stack</code> field contains a tuple
containing the list’s style and the last known number.  With this information,
any style can easily be handled by a list at any level of nesting.</p>

<p>Following the design, the configured style is used, allowing for a change
if the <code>__one_or_ordered_style</code> style is selected.  In that case, if the
list’s number is not 1, then it must be an ordered style.  However, if it
is 1, then the class is still in flux, and the algorithm needs to wait.</p>
<p>As to the validity of the list number at that point, it is an easy decision.
For any case other than the <code>__one_or_ordered_style</code> style, there is a small
set of possible starting values.  If it is not one of those values, the
rule triggers.  Otherwise, the value must be <code>1</code> which is valid no matter
what.</p>

<p>Except for the <code>one_or_ordered</code> logic, the <code>__match_non_first_items</code> function is the
same as the <code>__match_first_item</code> function.  It is only in the case where
the first List Item started with a <code>1</code> that the style is left undecided.
But when the algorithm gets to the second List Item, that ambiguity is
either resolved or triggers the rule.  As the above code indicates, if the
<code>__match_non_first_items</code> function is called with that style still in place,
it is either set to <code>__one_style</code> or <code>__ordered_style</code>, depending on whether
the new number is set to <code>1</code> or not.  The code after that change then
decides whether the <code>new_number</code> content is valid or not.</p>
<p>I did start out with something a bit more complicated, but as usual, the
simpler solution won out.  While it was not that much more complicated,
it just felt like I was stretching too much when a simpler approach
was just as efficient at solving the problem.</p>
<h2 id="list-element-spacing">List Element Spacing<a class="headerlink" href="#list-element-spacing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While it may not seem like much, Rule Md030 is meant to protect against
parsers that have a more rigid definition of the spacing that exists
between the List Item indicators and the text within the List Item.
And since it was one of the remaining ones to deal with, it felt that
pairing it with Rule Md030 was just the right thing to do.</p>
<h3 id="design_2">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I’ll admit it.  I copied most of the concepts from the previous rule to
this one and adjusted from there.  That was possible because they both deal solely with lists and
have similar constraints.  In this case, the configuration values were stable,
even with having to design “wait in this case until…” code.  The twist in this
rule was in calculating whether the List Item was on a single line or on
multiple lines.</p>
<p>Therefore, the design was mostly about adapting the design instead of thinking
through the design from scratch.  The List Item stack was required to make sure
that the algorithm compared List Items within its bounds, and not deeper. As
the composition of the list, single line elements throughout or containing any
multiple line elements, cannot be figured until the list is finished,
all List Item tokens need to be collected until the end List element.  Given
the single vs multiple classifications at that point, the correct configuration
value can then be chosen and applied to each token.</p>
<p>Which left one thing left to design: to design the “single vs multiple” algorithm.
Reading the definition of the original rule an extra time, I noticed that it was
very clearly documented that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A document style may change the number of spaces after unordered list items and
ordered list items independently, as well as based on whether the content of every
item in the list consists of a single paragraph or multiple paragraphs
(including sub-lists and code blocks).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made most of the algorithm simple.  Check to see if the difference in line numbers
between one List Item and the previous List Item is greater than one.  If so, it is
a multiple line set of List Items.  The very last List Item was a tricky one, but not
difficult to design around.  Every List Item must contain something, even if it is
a Blank Line token.  Therefore, the algorithm would need to keep track of the last
non-end token encountered, to deal with that final case.</p>
<p>Looking through things, I felt that I had covered everything in the design,
and it was time to proceed with the next phase.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation_2">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once again taking out my pen and scrap paper, I whittled down the
relevant test scenarios to eight scenarios: four for the Ordered List elements
and four for the Unorder List elements.  I came up with a handful of weird
cases, but in the end, they all reduced to those eight scenario tests.
While I am not 100% sure of that statement, I am confident enough in that
statement to proceed with the coding.  Basically, I have a feeling that
I might has missed something, but after searching for it for an hour or
so, I stopped looking.</p>
<p>The first part of the code has all the hallmarks of the previous rule.
The <code>__list_stack</code> code is almost the same, with just a bit more code
being executed in each <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p>Having that code in place, the only part that was remaining was the
code to determine if the list contains only single line List Items
or if any of the List Items have multiple lines.  For every List
Item except for the last one, its vertical size can only be calculated
against the next List Item.  But it does make for a simple loop.</p>

<p>And because of the clear designing, I knew ahead of time that the last
List Item was going to be a different scenario and how to address it.
As that last List Item does not have a following List Item to compare
it to, the last non-end token serves as a good stand-in.</p>
<p>Once again, I ran through all the cases, looking for that something
that I missed and not finding anything.  Everything was working and
passing, so after that extra checking, I finished up the documentation
for the rule and committed it to the repository.</p>

<p>For getting restarted on the project after about a weeks’ absence, it
took me a bit to get going.  But now that I see that the end of the
rules implementation phase is in sight, I am eager to get it completed.
Stay tuned!</p>

<p>That may sound like a weird statement to some.  For example, I make it a practice to name functions after the action they take.  Hence, the function <code>__handle_list_end</code> performs the handling for the end of the list.  But I have also seen function names like <code>handle</code>, <code>done</code>, and other names that do not imply that context.  Reading those functions is not fun. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:duh" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
