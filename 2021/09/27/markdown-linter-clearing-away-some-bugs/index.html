<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/09/20/markdown-linter-race-to-the-finish/">last article</a>, I talked
about the work I put into getting the final three rules completed. In this article, I
talk about getting to work on reducing the count of bugs in the Issues List.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With all the work on creating the missing rules wrapped up, I was eager to double check things for
the beta release, and get it packaged and uploaded to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi.org</a>.
But after that was done, I knew that I still had to work to do, simply different work.
Instead of writing new rules, I needed to go back over previous issues I have found and
start dealing with the “I’ll deal with it later” issues.</p>
<p>Yes, it was now “later”.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/47ab4e6e6c57c4187398870ffb9632375975fd64">21 Sep 2021</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/a5669f0f5b956b38447924eff78427f0c52aef1a">25 Sep 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-beta-release-happens">The Beta Release Happens<a class="headerlink" href="#the-beta-release-happens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From a commit point of view, the beta release was not anything more than changing a couple
of files and running a script that I normal do not run.  But mentally, it was an important thing for me.
After working for two years to get something working on my terms, I was able to finish
a beta release that I am confident about.  Running that script knowing that it would
publish a solid, well-tested version of my project to the Python <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPi</a>
repository just seemed right.  It was not too soon, it was not with reservations, it was
just the right time for the release to happen.</p>
<p>Do I expect issues to get logged in GitHub?  Yes, I would be surprised if issues were not
logged.  First off, I know I have confidence that I covered most of the more common scenarios, but
I also have confidence that I did not cover all the scenarios. Secondly, as weird as it
may sound, if people are filing issues, it means they are using the project and putting
it through their own scenarios.  And hopefully, for every issue that gets logged
with GitHub, there is a given multiplication factor of users that do not have any issues
with the project, and are therefore happy with the project.</p>
<p>What is that multiplication factor?  I do not currently know.  But even if that multiplication factor
is in the single digits, it means that people are using the project.  That is good for
my confidence.  That is all that I need, nothing more.</p>
<p>And as usual, before digging into fixing issues, there was a bit of cleaning up
that I wanted to get done.</p>
<h2 id="doing-some-house-cleaning">Doing Some House Cleaning<a class="headerlink" href="#doing-some-house-cleaning" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having a <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/clean.cmd">clean script</a>
and a
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml">Continuous Integration script</a>
has been a big asset for the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.
I am usually fussy about running the clean script before every commit, but the
Continuous Integration script makes sure that I stick to that process.  Normally, I develop on a
Windows machine because I have more tools that work seamlessly with how I work.    But
that still leaves testing on other operating systems, which has previously been painful.
The Continuous Integration script addresses that by running the full set of
tests against a Windows operating system, a Mac operating system, and a Linux operating system.
Having this process done automatically with each commit has helped me concentrate on
the project itself, not the operating systems.</p>
<p>But one little thing has been bugging me during the rule development phase: changing command
lines.  There are a small handful of rules that I want to disable on my own Markdown
scans. In most cases, this is temporary while I get everything else worked out and
think about possible rule changes.  In some cases, it is just to give me time to
fix the issues instead of disabling it.
These disabled rules are
no-space-in-code,
no-space-in-emphasis,
line-length, and
no-duplicate-heading.
That is not what I was concerned about.  It was that when developing the rules,
I needed to change the disabled rules in both scripts.  That just was not cool.</p>
<p>Before I started tackling reported issues as they trickle in, I decided that I wanted
to fix that right away.  It was not a tremendous change to make, but I believe it was a
good choice to work on as it would be one less thing to worry about.  Additionally,
it showed off a real-world use of the configuration file, which was a benefit.</p>
<p>To perform this switch to use a configuration file, I
created a new file, <code>clean.json</code> with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">"plugins"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">"no-space-in-code"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"enabled"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="nt">"no-space-in-emphasis"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"enabled"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="nt">"line-length"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"enabled"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="nt">"no-duplicate-heading"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"enabled"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Saving it in the root directory of the repository, I then went and replaced this
part of the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>--disable-rules no-space-in-code,no-space-in-emphasis,line-length,no-duplicate-heading
</pre></div>
<p>in both scripts to read:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>--config ./clean.json
</pre></div>
<p>I executed the clean script locally and verified that everything looked correct.
Hoping that I
did not miss anything, I created a new commit for this change, pushed it to main
repository, and watched as the tests started to run.  It took about four minutes,
but when I saw that green circle besides the tasks saying that everything executed
correctly, I let go a little “Yes!” to myself.</p>
<p>Not a big issue, and an issue that no one except me would probably worry about.
But it was an issue that I was happy to get taken care of.</p>
<h2 id="issue-23-issue-with-rule-md023"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/23">Issue 23</a> - Issue with Rule Md023<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-23-issue-with-rule-md023" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I know it might seem weird to some people, but I love debugging.  It gives me a chance to really
dig into something and either learn about it or increase my knowledge about how it works.
Sometimes I learn that I did not think of a given use case, and sometimes I learn that
I forgot something completely.  That last one was the case with this issue: I forgot
to implement pivotal code in Rule Md023.</p>
<h3 id="token-history">Token History<a class="headerlink" href="#token-history" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To understand the issue, I need to go into a bit of parser history to explain that the
<code>end_whitespace</code> within a Text token that existing within a SetExt Heading element was a bit
tricky to store.  Because whitespace must be removed from both the start of each line
and the end of each line in a SetExt Heading element, it left me with a fun decision to make: where to put the
removed whitespace?  Because one of the project’s cardinal parser rules is that any parsing must
produce a set of tokens that can then reconstitute the Markdown document exactly as it was.
As such, the whitespace had to go somewhere.  If it was a normal paragraph, only the
leading whitespace from each line would be removed and stored within the Paragraph
element that owns that Text token.</p>
<p>After considering assorted options, none of them were attractive.  But the least
unattractive was to override the <code>end_whitespace</code> field to hold both the leading space
characters and trailing space characters that were removed.  Normally, I would do this by having two different
fields, one for the leading spaces and one for the trailing spaces.  But not wanting to
add an extra field to the Text token just for use within a SetExt Heading element, I
improvised.  The <code>end_whitespace</code> would normally hold any trailing spaces, separated
by the newline character.  So, to “duplex” each line, if there were any leading spaces to
store in the same line, it would be followed with the <em>whitespace split character</em>,
<code>\x02</code>.  In that way, I was able to store both leading spaces and trailing spaces
within the same field.</p>
<h3 id="back-to-the-issue">Back To the Issue<a class="headerlink" href="#back-to-the-issue" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Going back to the issue at hand, that special character presented an issue that I
had not thought about when I was writing this rule.  Reminding myself of this,
I looked at the existing code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__setext_start_token</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__any_leading_whitespace_detected</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_whitespace</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="s2">" "</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_whitespace</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__any_leading_whitespace_detected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Without support for the whitespace split character, that code was detecting
any whitespace that occurred at the start or the end of the line.  Since whitespace
at the start of the line would be encoded as <code>{space}\x02</code> and whitespace at the
end of the line as <code>{space}</code>, the above code would evaluate both as extra leading
whitespace.</p>
<p>The only way to fix this was to scan through the <code>end_whitespace</code> field, one
line of information at a time, looking for any cases where the sequence
<code>{space}\x02</code> was found.  To do that, I replaced the earlier code with the
following code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__setext_start_token</span>
    <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__any_leading_whitespace_detected</span>
    <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_whitespace</span>
<span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">split_end_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">end_whitespace</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">next_split</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">split_end_whitespace</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__seen_first_line_of_setext</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">split_next_split</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">next_split</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">whitespace_split_character</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">split_next_split</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">split_next_split</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]:</span>
                <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__any_leading_whitespace_detected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
        <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__seen_first_line_of_setext</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This code works by going through each line represented in the <code>end_whitespace</code> field,
one line at a time.  For each line, it splits the line’s information on the whitespace
split character.  If the whitespace split character is present, then the split will
result in the variable <code>split_next_split</code> having an array of two strings, with the
first element holding any characters in the line that occurred before the whitespace
split character.  Therefore, if at least one line has a <code>split_next_split</code> variable
of length <code>2</code> with a non-zero length, then that line has leading whitespace.</p>
<p>Thinking this was clever, I ran it through the first time, and was disappointed that
it failed.  After a couple of minutes of debugging, I remembered that the leading spaces
for SetExt Heading tokens are stored with that start token, not within the Text token
contained within.  Adding a bit of extra code to take care of that first case,
I executed the code again and everything worked fine!</p>
<p>Just to be sure, I created five new scenario tests for Rule Md023, each with a different
amount of trailing space at a different location.  Maybe it is a bit paranoid, but after
finding one example that failed, I wanted some extra insurance that I had fixed the
problem and fixed it properly.</p>
<p>It was an interesting feeling getting back to debugging non-rule code.  It partly
felt like it was something that I was used to, and partly that it was something
new and different.  It was an odd pair of feelings, but both were good feelings,
so I was okay with both.</p>
<h2 id="issue-22-issue-with-rule-md033"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/22">Issue 22</a> - Issue with Rule Md033<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-22-issue-with-rule-md033" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This issue was not really a big one, but it was reported as not making sense to users, so
I wanted to tackle it quickly. Rule Md033 deals with Raw HTML being exposed, either as
a HTML Block element or a Raw HTML Inline element.  I figured that I had missed something
simple and wanted to make sure it was set right.</p>
<p>It turned out that I had missed two small issues, both nuisances.  The first one
was that I included a close HTML tag, any normal HTML tag starting with <code>&lt;/</code>, in the list
of acceptable trigger items.  While I had thought that the original rule did fire one
this, extra checking revealed that it did not.</p>
<p>The other issue was a bit more nuanced, but just as small.  In HTML, there are
special sequences that allow for special handling of HTML documents.  Of special note,
these sequences are called out in the GFM documentation of the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#html-blocks">HTML Block element</a> by each one of them
having their own special HTML Block type.  These sequences are comment blocks, processing
instructions, declarations, and CDATA.  I had originally taken one of them,
the <code>![CDATA[</code> sequence and provided special behavior for that sequence, but that was not
good enough.  Given a simple example from one of the project’s users:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">#</span> <span class="n">title</span>

<span class="o">&lt;!</span><span class="c1">--TOC--&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Apparently, my habit of following a start HTML comment tag with whitespace was just that…
my habit.</p>
<p>So, to correct that issue, I change the code to allow for both CDATA and comments to be
detected on their own without any whitespace to follow.  Along with a change to the default
value to suppress processing instructions and declarations by default, this issue was
fixed.</p>
<p>It was not a big fix, but a good one to get out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="issue-27-issue-with-rule-md032"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/27">Issue 27</a> - Issue With Rule Md032<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-27-issue-with-rule-md032" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I must admit.  When I first saw this issue pop up, in my head I looked at it and went:
“No, that looks right!”  But after checking it more closely, the issue began to seep into
my brain.  Starting with something simple, the following Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>parsed cleanly.  Then the second example, the following Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>also parsed cleanly.  Fine.  I agreed with both of those.  Md032 deals with blank
lines around List elements, and everything looked good so far.  Then the third sample was
presented, one which was causing the rule to trigger.  A modification of the earlier
example, this one was:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and it triggered the rule each time.  From looking at the nested List elements, it was
obvious that it should not fire, so what was wrong?</p>
<p>Enabling debug for the rule, I was able to quickly narrow down on the issue.
Specifically, the third line sets up the third level of a
List element only to have the top two levels of those lists ended with the first level
List element on the fourth line.  As was shown from my debugging, there were two
end List element tokens in a row in the token stream.  That was something I had missed.</p>
<p>Looking at two lines from the rule, I was quickly able to nail
down the source of this issue.  In the following <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_new_list_item</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_number_delta</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>only the Blank Line token and a New List Item token prevent the rule from firing
if the previous token was an end List token.  That meant in this case, the first
end List token caused that <code>if</code> statement to be evaluated to <code>False</code> when that
second end List token was used in the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>It did not take much code or time to fix this properly.  By adding the
end List token to the <code>if</code> statement, it allowed the List elements to flow
properly when dropping multiple levels.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span>
    <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_new_list_item</span>
    <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_end</span>

<h2 id="issue-32-issue-with-rule-md037"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/32">Issue 32</a> - Issue with Rule Md037<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-32-issue-with-rule-md037" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every so often, you look at something you did and hope no one notices that you did it.
In this case, I had Issue 32 filed against it, so I had no choice.  Someone noticed it.</p>
<p>The Markdown itself was simple, and the point of focus was a single paragraph:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Read</span> <span class="k">all</span> <span class="n">readme</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">md</span> <span class="n">files</span><span class="p">.</span>  
<span class="k">And</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">changelog</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">md</span> <span class="n">files</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It was this sample that was triggering Rule Md037, looking for spaces inside of asterisks
that may show that an Inline Emphasis element was not completed properly.  There was
only one problem:  the was half-finished code commented out to deal with the actual search
for whitespaces.</p>
<p>Whoops!</p>
<p>Oh well, it happened.  After I got over a momentary feeling of embarrassment, I started to
look at the commented-out code and quickly decided that it would not work properly.
When the triggering section of the <code>next_token</code> function is entered, it has a list of
every token that occurred between the possible start of emphasis and the possible end
of emphasis.  The main thing I needed the code to do was to verify if the specific
pattern, whitespaces directly inside of the possible start or end, were present.</p>
<p>Instead of doing something fancy, I opted for something simple.  With both the possible
start and possible end sequences, this rule should only trigger if they were Text tokens.
If it is not a Text token, it cannot start or end with whitespace, so there was one aspect
of the issue dealt with.
The other was a good observation on what this was supposed to look for.  Since I needed
the function to look for directly inside of the emphasis sequences, I needed to have
the function check for the first character of the first token and the last character
of the last token.  If either of those specific characters were a space character,
then it was a space directly inside of the emphasis characters.  And to be extremely
specific, I needed to set it to detect either scenario, not both.<sup id="fnref:yes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:yes">1</a></sup></p>
<p>After going through that research,  I came up with the following code, exactly
what I just described above:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__emphasis_token_list</span>

<p>Once again, nothing stellar, but good simple corrections in the code.</p>
<h2 id="issue-33-issue-with-rule-md031"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/33">Issue 33</a> - Issue With Rule Md031<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-33-issue-with-rule-md031" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my blitz to get all rules completed and a beta release out the door, I had encountered
this Markdown when trying to get Rule Md031 to work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">list</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">```</span><span class="n">block</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">block</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">```</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">another</span> <span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With some more relaxed time on my hands now, I decided to look closely at this rule
and figure out what the problem with the rule was.  What I did not notice at the time is that this
was not a problem with the rule, this was a problem with the parser.  When executed,
the parser was stopping in this code with an exception.  It was something that needed
to be looked in to.</p>
<p>It took me a bit to figure out what was going wrong.  As I have been concentrating
on getting things done for the beta release, I have not spent considerable time in the parser
code.  If I had to guess, it has been at least six months since I last looked at the
parser code.  Luckily, with the comments and log messages that I placed in the code;
I was able to get up to speed quickly.</p>
<p>In the Leaf Block Processor module, there is code in the <code>correct_for_leaf_block_start_in_list</code>
function to properly correct the indent of a line when coming out of List element.
Originally, the <code>token_stack</code> state variable was used to track the List elements,
with plans to implement an easier mechanism for dealing with Block Quote elements.
However, when I started to implement support for Block Quote elements, I realized
how similar Block Quote elements and List elements really were.  In response to
that, the <code>token_stack</code> state variable was then repurposed for both elements, with
extra work on my behalf to clean up the code.</p>

<p>Basically, it looks like I missed a boundary use case.  In this case, the List element
was getting closed properly within the loop, but it was then followed by an assert
to verify that the remaining element on the stack was a list.  If it was a List token,
then there were extra verifications that I had in place to verify the sanity of the
parsing.</p>
<p>While slightly more verbose, once I understood the problem, the fix was simple: only
act on List tokens:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">repeat_loop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
<span class="n">is_remaining_list_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<p>Because this change fixed the parsing of that Markdown document,
I was able to take the <code>skip</code> tag off the
<code>test_md031_bad_fenced_block_in_list_in_block_quote</code> function.  In
addition, to make sure that fenced code blocks did not suffer from the
same issue, I added the
<code>test_md032_bad_fenced_block_in_list_in_block_quote</code> function to perform
the same test for Fenced Code Block elements.  This was a good find,
and I was happy to have it taken care of.</p>

<p>After working hard for two years, it was a relief to run the scripts
to package the project and to upload it to PyPi.org.  As I mentioned
earlier in this article, I just felt like it was the right time to do
it.</p>
<p>But there are still things to do to make it better, and I wanted to
keep on marching forward.  After measuring my progress for the last
two months in terms of the number of rules I completed per week, I
am not sure how, or if, I am going to measure progress going forward.
I mean, I am going to resolve issues, of that there is no doubt.
However, I cannot divine if the issues I pick are going to be easy
issues or difficult issues.</p>
<p>I guess the only thing I can do is to keep on going what I have
always done with this project:  keep on making it better!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Well, I hate to say it (well, no I don’t), but I am going to be fixing
issues for a while.  While some portions of that work will be boring, I will
try and make it more interesting by describing what I am doing and
my reasons for doing it.
Stay tuned!</p>
