<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/07/26/markdown-linter-getting-back-to-new-rules/">last article</a>, I talked
about starting to tackle the long list of rules that are not yet implemented.
I this article, I talk about the process I am making and my efforts to streamline
the process.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I started working on this task, I had 31 rules to implement.  By the start
of this week,  I was down to 28 rules.  As my work week was
filled with deep-thinking and experimentation, I had a feeling that most of my
project work would end up being done on the weekend.  And I was correct.</p>
<p>With two days to make some progress on the project, it was hard to find good,
solid blocks of time in between my other plans for the weekend.  But I did find
some of that time, and I tried to use that time to my benefit.  My goal was simple:
if possible, get more than three rules designed, implemented, and tested before
I started writing this article on Sunday.  To do that, I was going to have to
change how I was approaching the rules, and I hoped my plans would work out.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/08b07cbb459401a3dbf6d346a3576f4b45f1b075">27 Jul 2021</a>

<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/f7bcbed5253182bc5483c13418a2ebb743d5ce14">01 Aug 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="working-fast-and-efficiently">Working Fast and Efficiently<a class="headerlink" href="#working-fast-and-efficiently" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With 28 rules left to implement, I wanted to try and get into the habit of making decisions
on how to be more efficient.  As this is week 2 of working on these rules, if I can get more
efficient with how I design and implement these rules, hopefully I can complete the
entire set within seven weeks or less.</p>
<p>But the only way that I was going to do that if with some new personal rules.  The first
rule is that, while it is usually okay for me to experiment, now is not the time for that.
If I cannot come up with a clean design within 30 minutes, I need to move on to the next rule.
This should help me go through the existing list of rules and get the easier rules taken
care of.  On the next place through the list, I can extend that time if needed.  But for
now, I need to get the easy stuff done first.</p>
<p>The second personal rule is that if a rule takes more than two hours to get into a
semi-finished state, I need to save the work and move on.  If I am having issues with a
design after two hours, I got something wrong and I need to rethink that design.  But if
I am doing that after having designed the rule, it means I did not think
the design through and need to go back and redesign it.  And that takes time.</p>
<p>While neither of these rules are permanent, I am hoping that by starting this block of
work with these rules, I can quickly move through the easier rules.  Will they help?
Only one way to find out!</p>
<h2 id="rule-md010-hard-tab-characters">Rule Md010 - Hard Tab Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md010-hard-tab-characters" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>For years I have avoided using tab characters in anything except word processor
documents for one good reason: they are a holy war waiting to happen.  For those
readers not familiar with the term <code>holy war</code>, let me explain.  In development
terms, a holy war is a discussion that is never ending with no real, concrete
answer.  Some developers will swear by <code>always 4 characters</code>, others by
<code>always 2 characters</code> and others by <code>always a 4 character tabstop</code>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last paragraph, there is no real answer to the question.
To avoid starting that discussion, most of the coding and documentation
guidelines that I know of specify explicit rules on how an entered tab character
should be handled, including the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm">GFM specification</a>.
But while the specification lists the exact behavior a compliant Markdown
parser should use, that specification does not change how the author’s
editor may decide how to interpret that tab character.  In the end, it is
a lot easier to have the editor translate any tab character into the
author’s desired number of space characters, side-stepping the entire issue.</p>
<h3 id="design">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting with that information, I was quick to design a simple function that
would simply scan for any tab character on the line and trigger a rule if
it found any.  The problem?  The original rule has a configuration
setting that allows tab characters to be included in Code Block elements without
triggering the rule.</p>
<p>Using up most of my allowed design time, I was at an impasse.  While the
PyMarkdown parser has decent support for tab characters, it accomplishes
part of that support by replacing tab characters with a four space character tabstop.<sup id="fnref:tabstop"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tabstop">1</a></sup>
There is already a section in the Issues List titled
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/issues.md#bugs---tabs">Bugs - Tabs</a>
to really dig into the proper support for tab characters, but right now there
is a stopgap measure present.  With the stopgap replacement
of tab characters, there are no traces of the tab characters in the tokens,
leaving no way to detect them.  No matter what else I could try, those tab
characters will remain unreachable until I address the issues in that section.</p>
<p>So, with that research done, I course corrected back to the original, simple
design of scanning line-by-line.  I will revisit this later, but for now,
simple was the only available choice.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the course correction in the design phase, everything went fine with the
implementation and testing of this rule.  It was rather simple to come up with
the test cases, seeing as the special <code>code_block</code> configuration was not in
play.  As such, the detection loop was simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_line</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\t</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">next_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\t</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">next_index</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">extra_data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"Column: {next_index + 1}"</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_line_error</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">next_index</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">extra_error_information</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">extra_data</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="n">next_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\t</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">next_index</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="rule-md012-detect-extra-blank-lines">Rule Md012 - Detect Extra Blank Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md012-detect-extra-blank-lines" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blank Line elements are interesting elements in Markdown.  Grouped with the Link Reference
Definition element, it is in a group of elements that do not show up in a rendered
HTML document.  For every other element, there is some physical representation
in the generated document.  But not those two.</p>
<p>In the case of Blank Line elements, they primarily serve to delineate one element from
another element.  Need a new paragraph?  Use a blank line before the next paragraph.
Want to create a paragraph after specifying an SetExt Heading element?  Use a blank line.
Want to stop a List element before the next element starts?  Use a blank line.
In every case, they only provide a method to terminate the element that precedes them.</p>
<p>But other than that small task, there is nothing that they do.  And multiple blank
lines do not make any sense either.  A second blank line would terminate the element
that the first blank line terminated?  It just does not make sense.  Therefore,
this rule is in place to limit the documents to only one Blank Line element at a time.</p>
<h3 id="design_1">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I originally was thinking that the design had to be complicated, but as I worked
through the cases, I realized that the design could be a lot simpler than I thought.
At first, I thought I would have to include code to prevent this rule from firing
within Code Block elements and HTML elements.  But after checking things out, I
remembered that the text within those elements use the <code>\n</code> character instead of
the Blank Line element.  With those three elements excluded, it was enough to count
the number of consecutive Blank Line tokens, checking them against the configured
limit.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_1">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Nothing interesting to report here.  With a solid design in hand, it was easy to
create the test functions and their test data.  From there, as the detection design
was simple, the implementation was also simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_blank_line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__blank_line_count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__check_for_excess_blank_lines</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__blank_line_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="rule-md014-showing-bash-style-output">Rule Md014 - Showing Bash Style Output<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md014-showing-bash-style-output" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When writing articles that include Bash scripts, most authors start with
script blocks that look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">```</span><span class="n">shell</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">jacob</span><span class="nv">@system</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ls</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="n">jacob</span><span class="nv">@system</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="o">~</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">cat</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">file</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="err">```</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>But with the user’s account name, the system name, and the directory name
all exposed, most authors quickly trim that down to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">```</span><span class="n">shell</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ls</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cat</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">file</span>
<span class="o">```</span>
</pre></div>
<p>From experience, this format is only useful if the author interweaves
shell input and shell output together in the example, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">```</span><span class="n">shell</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">ls</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span>
<span class="n">file</span>
<span class="n">file2</span>
<span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cat</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">file</span>
<span class="o">```</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That text format is efficient as it makes it clear which lines are shell
input commands and which lines are shell output text.</p>
<p>But if that interwoven format is not desired, it is simpler to trim the
initial script down further to only reflect the shell input:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">```</span><span class="n">shell</span>
<span class="n">ls</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span>
<span class="n">cat</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">my</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dir</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">file</span>
<span class="o">```</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With those leading <code>$</code> characters removed, these lines can then be copied by the
reader into the clipboard and executed in their own Bash window.  Even though
this example is specific to the <code>/my/dir</code> directory, it can still be copied-and-pasted,
with the results being somewhat predictable.</p>
<h3 id="design_2">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The obvious starting point for this rule was detecting whether the
rule was looking at a token within a Code Block element.  Once that context is
established, it then becomes a simple matter of looking at each line in the
following Text token.  For each line, the rule looks for at least one line
that does not begin with the <code>$</code> character.</p>
<p>This simple design was made possible by a good design decision that I made
regarding Code Block elements.  To prevent accidental parsing of their content
as anything but a code block, I ensured that the encompassed Text token has an
exact recording of what is in that Code Block element.  While that decision
was made for another reason, it benefited me in this design.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_2">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With a solid design in place, the implementation for this rule was easy.
I just implemented each step of the design, one step at a time.  The
only addition to the design occurred when I questioned whether leading
whitespace before the dollar sign character (<code>$</code>) would affect the
triggering of the rule.  Double checking with the original rule, its
support of leading whitespace aligned with my thoughts, and the
design was adapted.  The rule now checked for a leading <code>$</code> character
after any leading whitespace was removed.</p>

<h2 id="rule-md033-no-html-in-markdown">Rule Md033 - No HTML in Markdown<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md033-no-html-in-markdown" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I remember the first time reading about this rule and wondered how it
would be properly used.  Now, it seems obvious: because there
was a need for it!  More specifically, this rule breaks down to two
main reasons for its existence: generation and security.</p>
<p>From the generation point of view, most of the Markdown parsers that
I have encountered translate the Markdown elements into HTML output.
But I have heard of parsers that translate the elements into intermediate
forms, such as the token format that the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project uses.
In such a case, embedding pure HTML into that document would most likely
result in the output not looking like the author intended.  For any
authors rendering the Markdown using one of those parsers, that is an
issue.</p>
<p>The other big reason is security.  If an author can place their
own HTML into a generated document, it is possible that they can make
that document do things it was not supposed to do.  For example, say
you want to allow someone to enter comments at a public kiosk.  For
whatever reason, there are requirements to let the kiosk users enter
their comments in Markdown or Plaintext.  If they can enter HTML as
part of the Markdown content, they can cause all manner of problems.
By removing the
ability to execute any HTML other than Markdown generated HTML, that
security hole is closed.</p>
<h3 id="design_3">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_3" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the experience of designing the other rules behind me, creating the design
for this rule was not difficult.  There are two main ways to get HTML
into a document: an HTML Block element and an inline Raw HTML element.
The Raw HTML element is easy in that its content is self-contained.
The HTML Block element is a bit more difficult in that the rule needs
to look for a Text element inside of an HTML Block element.</p>
<p>After detecting the HTML text, determining the “name” of the tag is
important for being able to allow only certain tags in a valid document.
In the original rule, this was limited to any opening HTML tag that
started with a alphabetic character.  The first thing I did was to ensure the
design for the HTML Block element allows for both an opening HTML tag and a closing
HTML tag.  With that out of the way, ans including a special case for
the <code>![CDATA[</code> HTML tag, collecting the name of the tag became
collecting the tag until one of the five terminating characters is
encountered.</p>
<p>With all the scenarios covered, I moved on to the testing and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_3">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_3" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once I had all the test scenarios identified and their test functions set
up, the actual code was easy to implement.  Starting with the Raw HTML
element, getting the <code>__look_for_html_start</code> function set up was
rapidly accomplished.  From there, I implemented the first pass with
the HTML Block element, including better support for tags with
non-alphabetic start characters.  Finally, after making sure everything
else was working properly, I made the small change to allow closing
HTML tags in addition to opening HTML tags.  It was an iterative process,
but one that flowed smoothly along with the design.</p>

<p>While it is more code than a fair share of the other rules, it was easy to
implement for a few reasons.  The first was the design phase.  While it
is true that I used my design phase test cases for the test scenarios,
the design was good enough to handle each of those test cases.  Therefore, the
second reason was those design test cases.  Before I started coding, I knew what
I was up against, and I was confident that I had identified all the test cases.  Finally,
I did not code the entire block of code at once.  I started with the easier parts of the
design and layered upon what was already done and tested until I was done.</p>
<p>It was at this point that I was sure that my rules were paying off.  As far as
I could tell, they were helping me to focus.  The next rule would test that though.</p>
<h2 id="rule-md027-false-start">Rule Md027 - False Start<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md027-false-start" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it is hard to keep to a self-imposed rule, and this was one of those times.
I am still not sure why I had a problem with this design, but I did.  I even gave myself
an extra five minutes, but even with that extra time, my design was nowhere near completed.</p>
<p>Looking back at that rule and my notes on that rule, I am not sure what happened.
I have a lot of things crossed out on the page where I was designing.  Taking another
look them, the things that I had crossed out as being wrong were actually correct.  Regardless,
I am going to say something very reasonable: Shit happens!</p>
<p>We all have bad periods throughout the day, and I just happened to hit one when I
tried to work on this rule.  It happens.  What was more important was what I did when
I encountered that situation: I realized it happened.  I was a bit upset with myself,
but I did the mental equivalent of dusting myself off, worked on one of my Saturday
home projects that I needed to deal with, and cooled down.  More importantly, I gave
myself some space from the project, and time to depressurize.</p>
<p>While the work that I did on the actual task is rather fuzzy, I do remember clearly
that I got it out of my system, and quickly.  I knew I would get back to it within
a week or two, and I would hopefully have a better experience with it at that point.
And for me, that was a good thing!</p>
<h2 id="rule-md035-consistent-horizontal-rules">Rule Md035 - Consistent Horizontal Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md035-consistent-horizontal-rules" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As soon as I came to this rule, I started to have flashbacks to
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/rules/rule_md004.md">Rule Md004</a>.
That was not a particularly nasty rule to implement or test, but I remember it as being
very finicky.  While I thought it was going to be trivial, it ended up being a fair amount
of work to get everything right.</p>
<p>But with everything being fair, I must admit that Rule Md004 was one of the reasons
that I decided to add my two new rules for this week.  That rule was the first one that
I started working on as I was recovering, and I did not have a lot of fun implementing it.
I do not remember much about it that was
positive, but I do remember having to restart the design two or three times to get it
right.  To be blunt, I do not know if that was because I rushed things and did not
do good design upfront or because I was still sick and did poor design.  At this stage,
it does not matter.  I want to learn from my mistakes, hence the new rules.</p>
<p>And this should be an easy one.  All Thematic Break elements must use a consistent
sequence.  Hoping that I did not just jinx myself, I started working on it.</p>
<h3 id="design_4">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_4" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>This design was simple from the start.  If the configuration value is set
to <code>consistent</code>, then do not set a sequence to match, otherwise the configuration
value is the sequence to match.  In the main token function, that means a small
amount of code to deal with setting the style to match if it is not set.  Once
that is out of the way, it is a simple comparison check: if it fails, it triggers
the rule.</p>
<p>It did seem too simple though…</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_4">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_4" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>But it was not.  This was one of the shortest times that I have spent on designing,
testing, and implementing a rule to date.  All the test scenarios were easy to
come up with and implement.  The algorithm was just as easy, and quickly coded
into a function:</p>

<p>And yes, I was a bit paranoid.  I did some extra checking for possible boundary
conditions, but there were none.  I think the ghosts of implementing that
other rule were just stuck in my head, and I could not stop listening to their
whispers.  But after that extra checking, things were good, and I moved on.</p>
<h2 id="rule-md037-missed-emphasis-sequences">Rule Md037 - Missed Emphasis Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md037-missed-emphasis-sequences" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>For me, the most interesting rules to develop are those rules where I have to
really think about their design and experiment with the existing data.  Even with
my two new rules in place, I knew that I would have to experiment on a couple
of the rules, and this was one of them.
That experimentation was to answer a simple question: what does a “missed”
emphasis look like.  When I started that research, I was worried that I
was going to have to do a lot of parsing for the 4 sequences that can
be used for emphasis.  Instead, my experimentation revealed that I had
already solved that problem.</p>
<p>Because of the way certain sequences need to be handled
by the PyMarkdown parser, there are a small set of character
sequences that are immediately classified as Special Text: emphasis characters and
link characters.  When any of those sequences are encountered, they
are put into Special Text tokens so that they are more readily
identifiable.  With no need to change them back, I just left each of those
sequences in the Special Text tokens.</p>
<p>And now, I got to benefit from that with this design.</p>
<h3 id="design_5">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_5" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>A lot of this design was simple, but I was aware that there were enough
moving parts in it to still make it a tricky design, if not a difficult one.
As mentioned above, one good thing is that the emphasis markers were already
parsed and stored in their own SpecialTextMarkdownToken instances.
Because of this, I did not have to do anything to look for those sequences;
they were already extracted for me.</p>
<p>From there, if the token was in one of the three <em>normal</em> text blocks, I needed
to increment a token list to keep track of the fact that any following text was
within an acceptable text block.  Then, if any following tokens were Text
tokens, go into a state where the rule looks for emphasis character sequences
in Special Text tokens.  Once an emphasis sequence is found, look for a matching
emphasis sequence to end the emphasized text.  Along the way, make sure to handle
normal boundary cases, such a unmatched emphasis sequence in a paragraph.</p>
<p>There were a lot of little “except for” parts in that design, so I used the
remaining time in my thirty minutes to work things out on paper with the
nine different test scenarios that I created Markdown documents for.  I
had to do a couple of small last-minute changes, but that was it.  It
was then on to the implementation phase, and I was a bit nervous about it.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_5">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_5" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The design for this rule was tricky, so I made sure to implement
all nine test functions ahead of time.  Knowing that the design had lots of
small, moving parts, I started with the easiest parts
of the design, and moved from there.  There were times that I got
lost and had to reset that individual section of code.  Other than that,
the implementation went smoothly.  The extra time that I spent in the design
phase helped me have confidence that I was taking the right approach.</p>

<h2 id="rule-md038-code-span-spacing">Rule Md038 - Code Span Spacing<a class="headerlink" href="#rule-md038-code-span-spacing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was just after noon on Sunday, and I wanted to get this rule out of the
way before writing this week’s article.  In my head, I quickly came up with
the design for this one, so I was pretty sure that I could get it done
in the time frame I had set for myself.</p>
<p>The big reason for this rule is correctness.  Except for a matching
pair of single spaces at the start and end of the code block, everything else
in the code block is preserved, as is.  That means that any unbalanced or extra
spaces at the start and end of the code block are preserved as well.  While it is
possible that this is what the author intended, there is one big problem with
this: different parsers handle those spaces differently.</p>
<p>Doing some quick experimentation with the string <code>this is ` a code` span</code> on
<a href="https://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/?text=this+is+%60+a+code%60+span%0A">Babelmark 2</a>,
there are parsers that preserve that space, remove that space, and even some that do
not consider that text to contain a valid code span.  By simply removing that leading
space, all parsers align on what the correct parsing and HTML output is for that
Markdown example.  And that is what this rule is about: matching the output to
what the author most likely expected the output to be.</p>
<h3 id="design_6">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_6" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is nice to end a week’s work with some simple stuff, and this was no exception.
Because the rule centers on the Code Span element, the design was simply to wait
for a Code Span element to appear, and then analyze the text within it.  From there
the rules are simple. Spaces at the start and end of that text are only acceptable
if there is exactly one at each end.  The only exception is that the sequence
<code>`{space}</code> at the start of the text and <code>{space}`</code> at the end of the text
are allowed.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-and-testing_6">Implementation and Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-and-testing_6" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the design being as small as it was, I did not encounter any issues implementing
the rule.  And with eight separate test functions to make sure things are working,
I was able to make quick work of this rule.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I got Rule Md038 into its mostly finalized state before starting my writing,
I was shocked.  Hoping to get four rules implemented, I had managed to get seven
done, and that was during the weekend.  This means I am down to just 21 rules of
the initial set to implement.  That was something to be proud of.</p>
<p>But more importantly, I was finding that my new temporary rules were helping me
focus and stay on track.  That was the real bonus.  When I got in trouble with
previous features, it sometimes took me days to find out how out of focus I
was.  And even if I realized that I was out of focus before then, there was the
feeling of giving up that I had to battle.</p>
<p>With my two new rules, I gave myself strict boundaries to help me accomplish
my goal.  And it worked.  But, as an added bonus, it helped me deal with the
emotional aspects of having to put the work down and move on to something else.
That was the big win!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yup, more rules, but I do not know which ones and how many I will get done.
Stay tuned!</p>
