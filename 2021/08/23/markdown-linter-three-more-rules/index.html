<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/08/16/markdown-linter-dealing-with-rule-md027/">last article</a>, I talked
about the work I put into getting Rule Md027 implemented. In this article, I
talk about the next three rules I worked on.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It felt good to get Rule Md027 off of the Issues List.  I hated
to put it on there a couple of weeks ago, but it was the right call at the
time.  And since I had to tackle it at some point, reserving a week to
work on it and deal with it last week was also the right call.</p>
<p>But with that work now completed, I needed to get back on track.  And the
closer I am getting to having all the rules implemented, the more I
want them to be done.  I know that is normal to feel that way, but I need
to make sure I temper that feeling with patience and keep following the rules
that got me here.</p>
<p>Once more into the breach I go!</p>

<h2 id="fenced-blocks-elements-and-blank-lines">Fenced Blocks Elements and Blank Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#fenced-blocks-elements-and-blank-lines" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having taken the entirety of last week to finish Rule Md027, I was hoping
that I could get this rule completed in less time than one week.  Just
from looking at the rule, it sure looked a lot simpler.  Instead of a whole
bunch of complicated stuff, just make sure that any Fenced Code Block
elements are surrounded by at least one Blank Line.</p>
<p>The rule looked simple. But was it really going to be simple?</p>
<h3 id="design">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Based on my initial looks at this rule, I determined that there were
going to be two groups of elements that I needed to deal with: the ones
that crossed container boundaries and ones that don’t.</p>
<p>As soon as I figured out that the second group will cross container
boundaries, I knew that I would need to keep track of the container
tokens and which one of those tokens were active.  Thanks to Rule Md027 and the other
rules before it, I had some good design and code that I could reuse.
That was one part of the design taken care of.  Now on to the main
part of the design: dealing with both groups.</p>
<p>Designing for that first group was easy.  For the opening of
the Fenced Code Block element, keep track of the token used the
last time the <code>next_token</code> function was called.  If a start Fenced
Code Block token is encountered, check that “last” token to see
if it is a Blank Line token. The closing sequence is almost the same
but in reverse.  Once the end Fenced Code Block token is encountered,
set a variable to keep on looking for tokens.  In the next pass through
the <code>next_token</code> function, check to see if that token is a Blank Line token.</p>
<p>Logically, those two patterns came easy to me.  Track the Blank Lines in
case we find a start Fenced Code Block element that needs them and track
the Blank Lines after we found an end Fenced Code Block element.  Both
made sense.  That was easy… almost too easy.  Then the design for
the second group came into focus.</p>
<p>For the second group, that design was going to require adjustments to
the existing design. For the opening part of the design, the “last”
token variable should only be
set if the token is not related to a container open or closing.  In that
way, it can span those container boundaries without any issues.  After
I ran through some simple examples in my head, I was sure that I had
the right design for the opening part.</p>
<p>For the closing part, I started thinking that the same
consideration applies.  But after some thought, I realized it did not.
From the point of view of the Fenced Code Bock element, if it exists
inside of a container element, it makes sense to look after any end
tokens to determine whether any Blank Lines follow the Fenced Code Block
element.  The element does not care if those end tokens are there as
they simply offer a logical encapsulation of an element.  In most
cases, the end tokens do not represent actual text in the document.
Thus, if a new element and its token are present instead of the required
Blank Line, it should trigger the rule.</p>
<p>Taking a second look at those designs, things looked solid.  It was time
to move on.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the massive 85 scenario tests last week for Rule Md027, I was happy when
I counted the scenario tests for this rule, and I ended up with 16 scenario tests.
They started with the simple tests without containers and quickly morphed
into those simple tests with containers.  The 16 scenario tests were a
quantity of scenario tests that I could easily deal with.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Starting to work on the rule implementation, getting the tests
for the first group passing was the priority.  Following the
design, I created a simple function that dealt with the before
and after cases properly, as well as setting the last token.</p>
<p>Handing off the processing of the before case to the
<code>__handle_fenced_code_block</code> function, that function proved easy
to implement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__handle_fenced_code_block</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_non_end_token</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_non_end_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Just like the design specified, if the last token before the
start Fenced Code Block token is not a Blank Line, trigger the
rule.  Furthermore, because the design stipulates that end tokens
were not important, only non-end tokens will be in the
<code>__last_non_end_token</code> variable.</p>
<p>While the before case with the first function was easy to implement,
the handling of the after case and the <code>__handle_end_fenced_code_block</code>
function was a bit trickier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__handle_end_fenced_code_block</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>The detection part of the function was straight forward, taken
care of by the first statement and the last two statements of the
function.  The focus for this function was calculating the
deltas to apply to the token’s line number and column number.  As
end tokens do not contain any position information, the position of
the end token needs to be reconstructed using information from
the start Fenced Code Block token and the Text token within the
block.  Once that calculation was performed, a small variance was
needed to alter the column delta to compensate for any indent of
the end Fenced Code Block token, and it was done.</p>
<p>Then it was on to the container tokens.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-group">The Second Group<a class="headerlink" href="#the-second-group" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having track container tokens and their scopes for a couple of
rules, I have an established pattern for handling containers.  Therefore,
that code was easy to add at the start of the main function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_start</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_end</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">del</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_start</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_end</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">del</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_fenced_code_block</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To complete the handle of the before case, I needed to change
the <code>if</code> statement around the setting of the <code>__last_non_end_token</code>
variable.  To ensure that a new container does not disrupt
this check, the <code>if</code> statement was changed slightly to ensure
that it does not set the <code>__last_non_end_token</code> on either of
the end container tokens or the start container tokens:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_end_token</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_start</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_start</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_non_end_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With those in place, the Blank Line checks in both
helper functions only required a simple change to ensure
that they would fire properly with start List elements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span> <span class="ow">and</span> \
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_start</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Doing my usual due diligence, I went through the code and
tightened up variable names and organized the code to my standards.
I then went through and experimented with about ten different
container scenarios, checking to see if the rule fired properly
for each of them.  In each case, the rule fired properly, and I
was able to reduce the experimental scenario down to a scenario
that was already present in a scenario test.</p>
<h3 id="adding-configuration-support">Adding Configuration Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-configuration-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With everything working and double checked, I added code to respond
to the <code>list_items</code> configuration value.  Once loaded in the
<code>initialize_from_config</code> function, responding to it in the code was easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">can_trigger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_list_start</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">can_trigger</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__trigger_in_list_items</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">can_trigger</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The last example from the previous section was simply altered to
allow the rule to trigger in a general case.  In the case where
the trigger is occurring within a List element, it allows triggering
based on the configured value.  Not a bit change, but it was
nice that the scope was small.</p>
<p>Checking everything again, I committed the change and started looking
at the next rule.</p>
<h2 id="list-elements-and-blank-lines">List Elements and Blank Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#list-elements-and-blank-lines" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Knowing that there is efficiency in working on tasks that share
a common theme, I decided to find another rule that was not yet
implemented and deals with Blank Lines like Rule Md031.  I did not
have to look far before I found Rule Md032.   Dealing
with List elements and Blank Lines, I hoped that I could leverage
my work from Rule Md031 to get this rule implemented quickly.  But,
as always, design first before implementation.</p>
<h3 id="design_1">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To be honest, I really did not do that much design on this rule.  Once
I started figuring out the design on paper, I quickly realized that
it was a watered-down version of Rule Md031.  There was the same
concern about working properly within containers, and the same concern
about tracking what happened at the start of the element and at the end
of the element.  Other than the token being tracked, they looked the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, the change of token and my previous design for Rule Md031 made
it trivial to design.  Remove the logic for Fenced Code Block elements,
replace them with logic for the List elements, and I was practically done.</p>
<p>From there, it was time for testing and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation_1">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Following the same process for generating test scenarios as with
Rule Md031, I quickly came up with a solid group of ten scenario
tests for this rule.  Like the design work for this rule,
almost all the scenarios were just slightly changed versions
of the scenarios from the previous rule.</p>
<p>From there, it just made sense to use the code for Rule Md031
as a base, modifying it as needed.  This was not a difficult task.
The Block Quote token related portions of the rule did not change,
and the code for the Fenced Code Block tokens and List tokens
were merged.  Between those changes, it was less than
five minutes before I got the first scenario test to pass.
The rest of the scenario tests were passing in quick order
as well.</p>
<p>Everything was quickly working properly in all scenarios, except for two
of the more unusual scenarios. In these scenarios, there is a transition
from a Block Quote element to a List element and then to another element.
To be honest, I do not remember every having written a document
where those elements were nested in that fashion, but as it is
allowable by the specification, I knew that I needed to support it.</p>
<p>So, after doing some debugging with these scenarios, the solution
was to move one block of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__end_list_end_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_new_list_item</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_number_delta</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__end_list_end_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to the start of the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__end_list_end_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_new_list_item</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">report_next_token_error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_number_delta</span><span class="o">=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__end_list_end_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Based on my debugging, the <code>if</code> conditions that preceded the
original position of the statement were causing the other handlers
for the container tokens to be executed instead of that block of
code.  By placing it at the start of the function, the <code>if</code> block was
guaranteed to be executed without the container tokens getting in the way.</p>
<p>Having discovered and fixed this issue for Rule Md032, I started
to wonder if I had missed it as well in other rules that I had
recently worked on.  I needed to check it out.</p>
<h3 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In going over the scenario tests for this rule, I realized that I
may have missed some scenario tests in some of the rules that recently
worked on.  Adding additional scenario tests to those projects, I soon
had a small list of things that I fixed.</p>
<p>Adding four scenario tests to the tests for Rule Md031, I found that
the Fenced Code Block elements within certain containers were not
behavior properly, as was the case for Rule Md032.  In that case, I
solved the issue in the same way by moving the end Fenced Code Block
handling to the top of the function.  A couple of extra passes over
the code, and everything looked good.</p>
<p>Likewise, after adding four scenario tests to Rule Md022, I noticed
that I had missed some scenarios with the handling of the end Block
Quote tokens.  Taking some time to debug, the problems with these
scenarios proved easy enough to fix, simply requiring the addition of
<code>and not token.is_block_quote_end</code> to two of the existing conditions.
While I initially added another three scenario
tests for a total of seven new scenario tests, I eventually decided
that those scenarios were duplicates of the base four scenarios and
removed them.</p>
<p>Having done that work, I look at the scenario tests for Rule Md027,
to see if there was anything that I missed for that rule and found
nothing obvious.  However, during that exploration, I was not happy with the
way that the code looked and did some refactoring on the code to
make it clearer.  Nothing drastic, just little changes here and there
to make it read better.</p>
<h3 id="taking-the-time">Taking The Time<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-the-time" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if things like this just waste of my time.  I mean,
instead of taking time to look at issues like these, I could be starting
on a new rule or addressing some other issue.  But then I take a breath
and realized that it is the right thing for me to do.  In the above
cases, I found some new scenarios for what I was working on and wondered
if the more recent rules handled them properly.  The absolute worst
scenario was that I consumed time and did not get much in return.  The
absolute best is that I found issues in all three rules and fixed them.
As it was, I found issues in two of the rules, and code that I was
not 100% happy with in the third rule.</p>
<p>Call me an optimist, but I think that was a good use of my time.  But
now that I had that finished, it was time to get one last rule in this
week.</p>
<h2 id="unordered-list-indentation">Unordered List Indentation<a class="headerlink" href="#unordered-list-indentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, I plan an order to my tasks to make my work more efficient.
Sometimes, I look back and wish that I had planned my work in a different
order so that I could be more efficient.  At my first glance of this
rule, I was not sure which of those categories this rule was in.</p>
<p>The only way to find out?  Dig right in and get to work.</p>
<h3 id="design_2">Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>At a high level, the design of this rule is simple: make
sure that there is an expected level of indentation for Unordered
List elements.  By itself, that was an easy concept to design for.  The
algorithm would assume that an item in an Unordered List element
would be indented by 2 space characters as a default.
Therefore, the very first List element would be a level 1 List element,
indented by 0 space characters, the List element within that List would
be a level 2 List element and indented by 2 space characters, as so on.
From a design point of view, that means checking the current indentation
against the equivalent of <code>level-1 * 2</code>, and triggering if the indentation
is different.</p>
<p>The interesting parts of that design were what followed that initial
design.  And yes, they are all about container tokens.</p>
<h4 id="container-tokens">Container Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#container-tokens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The above design assumes that there is a simple definition of what the
current indentation is, and that is not always the case.  In the case
of this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>the definition of current indentation on the first level is <code>0</code>, and on
the second level is <code>2</code>.  Those indentations are easy to calculate because there
is literally nothing before that List element on each line.</p>
<p>But taking one step into container blocks, this simple example changes
that definition somewhat:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
   <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="mi">2</span> 
</pre></div>
<p>In this example, the indentation for the first line is still <code>0</code>, but the
indentation for the second line is <code>3</code>.  This is because the level 1 List
element is an Ordered List element whose text and spacing creates a base
indentation of <code>3</code>.  This means that the indentation of <code>3</code> for the Level
1 Unordered List element is correct.  I had to remind myself (many times)
that while Ordered List elements and Unordered List elements are both List
elements, they are not the same.  And as they are not the same, they are
treated differently.</p>
<p>This idea extends to Block Quote elements as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Because the Block Quote element includes the space after the <code>&gt;</code> character,
it has a base indentation of <code>2</code>.  Therefore, the Unordered List element
has an indentation of 0 spaces after the Block Quote sequence.</p>
<p>Once nesting of container elements comes into play, things get messy quickly.
But at their basis are those three examples.  I worked through a couple or
the more complex nesting example and made sure that they are taken care of.
From what I could see from the ones I chose, things looked good.</p>
<h4 id="block-quotes-and-leading-spaces">Block Quotes And Leading Spaces<a class="headerlink" href="#block-quotes-and-leading-spaces" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Having written a good design and implementation of traversal of Block Quote
tokens and their <code>leading_spaces</code> lines, I knew that this design should
leverage that work.</p>
<p>One of my refactoring rules is “Code it twice, on the fence; code it
thrice, don’t do it again”.  As this was the second time, I wanted to
try and capture the previous work in one or two functions that I
could refactor into the old rules with later.  What was important
to me was that I did not have to write it “one more time” after this.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, I continued to design for the container tokens.</p>
<h4 id="designing-for-container-tokens">Designing For Container Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-for-container-tokens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Given those constraints and that research, I was now ready to design the tough
part of this rule: the definition of the current indentation.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this rule, the current indentation is the number of spaces
required to get back to the last meaningful container token that serves as an
anchor for the Unordered List element.  If there are no such tokens, then the
anchor is the start of the line.  Because Unordered List elements nest nicely,
this means that the algorithm needs to go back to before any such nesting
occurs.  From there, the algorithm needs to leverage the data stored within
the other container tokens to establish that anchor token.  Once the anchor
token is established, the indentation for a token is the number of space
characters required to get back to that anchor token’s column.  Phew!</p>
<p>While I had the general design figured out, I knew in advance that I was
going to have to be fluid with the second half of the implementation of
finding the anchor token.  I have written enough rules to know that sometimes
the List elements and Block Quote elements can play off each other in
weird ways, and I needed to consider that from the outset. To me,
this was not going “meh, I’ll design it later”, it was “I cannot design
it until I get there”.  Seeing as I have been very good at doing design
before implementation, one intentional deviation with a good reason
behind it wouldn’t hurt.</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-implementation_2">Testing and Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-and-implementation_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Working through all the scenarios, I ended up with 28 scenarios to
test.  The good part of that is that 9 of those scenario tests were
from the refactored <code>leading_spaces</code> code, so hopefully this would
be one of the last times those needed to be tested.</p>
<p>Moving on to the <code>next_token</code> function, it started simple and
remains simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_unordered_list_start</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_new_list_item</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__container_token_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_unordered_list_start</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__check</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">manage_container_tokens</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The core of this rule is very simple.  If the token is starting
an Unordered List element or is a new List Item within an existing
Unordered List element, the rule needs to check if it is properly
indented.  Otherwise, the <code>manage_container_tokens</code> function manages
the container token stack’s <code>__container_token_stack</code> variable and any required
index into a Block Quote token’s <code>leading_spaces</code> field.</p>
<p>For the small portion of tokens that get selected for further checking,
the <code>__check</code> function handles that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__check</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Per the design, the base column and two other variables are
calculated based on what is currently in the <code>__container_token_stack</code>
variable.  With that information, the token’s <code>column_number</code> field can
be adjusted to switch from a column number based on the line to an
indentation based on the anchor token.  Then, using the <code>list_depth</code>
variable, the <code>calculated_column_number</code> variable can be calculated,
leading to a comparison between the <code>calculated_column_number</code> variable
and the <code>adjusted_column_number</code> variable.</p>
<h4 id="calculating-the-base-column">Calculating The Base Column<a class="headerlink" href="#calculating-the-base-column" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Calculating the base column turned out to be the function that
took the most time to figure out.  As I noted before, I allowed for
a certain amount of fluidity in the design for this function, and I
used most of it up getting this function right.</p>

<p>For the scenarios that do not have any tokens in the token stack, this
function returns simple default values.  Otherwise, this function starts
at the end of the stack and works its way to the start of the list.</p>
<p>The first <code>while</code> loop gets rid of the easy tokens on the stack: the
Unordered List tokens.  As these tokens stack together nicely, nothing
special is needed in processing these tokens other than incrementing
the <code>list_depth</code> variable for later.</p>
<p>The second <code>while</code> loop takes care of the other container tokens.  Once
again, if there is nothing left on the stack (i.e. <code>stack_index == 0</code>),
nothing more processing is needed.  However, if there are more tokens
left on the stack, they are Block Quote tokens and Ordered List tokens.
To properly figure out what the base column is, those tokens need to
be examined until the beginning of the stack is reached.  At that point,
the proper base column should be in the <code>container_base_column</code> variable.</p>
<h4 id="taking-the-long-way">Taking The Long Way<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-the-long-way" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>It took quite a bit of effort and time to figure out the
base column part of this rule, even if it was theoretically
simple.  I was right in thinking that the List elements and the
Block Quote elements would play off each other.  As it is,
I went a couple of levels deep in the container elements and
got those right, but I didn’t go deeper.  In hindsight, I am hesitant
to say that I got all the combinations of container elements.  However,
I am confident enough to say that I believe I got most of the
combinations that matter.</p>
<p>And with that, I stopped working on the rule and started
working on this article.  Taking a couple of breaks, I did
my usual cleaning up and linting of the rule, before committing
it to the project.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From a pure numerical standpoint, the number of completed rules
is now 23 and the number of rules remaining is now 8.  As my
expected benchmark was 3 completed rules per week, I was
successful in meeting that goal.  From a quality point of
view, I was able to find a handful of new parser issues, logging
them for future fixing.  While they will require future work to fix
them, I see those issues as issues that users of the project will not find.
And from an efficiency point of view, things were going well.
My adherence to my design rules were serving me well and keeping
me focused.</p>
<p>The only negative?  I still have 8 rules left to finish.  I know
it might sound like whining, but I really want to get those rules
implemented so I can release and fix the issues that I have found.
And because of that impatience, I had to take a couple of extra
breaks this week to make sure that I was working on the project
with the right mindset.</p>
<p>And yes, I am a glass-half-full type of guy.  How did you guess?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It felt good to get more than one rule done.  For next week,
I know I am going to be close to finishing off the rules,
but I won’t know if I get there until next Sunday. Stay tuned!</p>
