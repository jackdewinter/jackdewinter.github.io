<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/12/20/markdown-linter-getting-back-to-work/">last article</a>, I talked
about getting back to work on testing the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a> project.
In this article, I talk about taking some time to do things right.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you just need to take some time and get things done right.  In the last
couple of weeks, I made major modifications to the whitespace tracking system used
within the PyMarkdown project.  And that brought out some issues.  Some of those
issues were hiding from before, and some of those are new issues.  Both need to be
fixed.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-what-is-importand-to-me">Figuring Out What Is Importand To Me<a class="headerlink" href="#figuring-out-what-is-importand-to-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>So, that happened.  After I rewrote the whitespace tracking system, I added a couple
of assert statements to make sure that I did not lose track of those whitespace
characters again.  And they triggered.  I thought I had all combinations put together
and tested, but I missed some.  The question was, how many other ones did I miss?</p>
<p>As fate would have it, the morning before I was supposed to head over the mountain
to visit my relatives, there was a Winter Weather Advisory for the mountains passes
that I use to get over there.  I talked about going over the mountain with my wife
and her father, and we all agreed that safety and sanity were our number one priorities.
So, I stayed at home.</p>
<p>Now, I have other stuff I want to get done as well, but I had around three days
of “extra” time available to me.  How did I want to spend it?  I love movies, and
I am watching a couple of movies a day, as well as getting caught up on various
series.  But that only takes up so much time.  And I like to be doing stuff that
has focus.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I had to figure out what was important for me to accomplish during
the period between Christmas Eve Day and New Years Day.  I do want to work on
getting some other smaller projects ready for publishing, and that is a priority
for me.  Doing some learning is also a priority, as learning helps me professionally
and it also recharges my batteries.  But what about the PyMarkdown project?</p>
<p>I am firm that I do not want to spend all my time on the PyMarkdown project, but
with the question of “what did I miss?” hanging over my head, I wanted to at
least be able to answer that question.  More importantly, I want to be able to
have a good idea of the scope of the issues, as well as their impact on the project
itself.</p>
<h2 id="making-that-decision">Making that Decision<a class="headerlink" href="#making-that-decision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With that in mind, I decided to take a solid three days and to add a new level of
testing to the PyMarkdown project.  It was not going to be an easy three days
or a fun three days, but it was something that I felt I needed to do.  The way
I figured it out in my head, each day was going to be focused on one part of
putting the new scenario tests together.  Day One was dedicated to simply grunting
through the creation of all the test functions with their Markdown. Day Two was
dedicated to the painful process of executing every new scenario test and marking
each failed test as skipped.  Day Three was dedicated to going through the failures
and categorizing those failures into categories.</p>
<p>And in case anyone asks, yes, there are that many combinations.  To be blunt, the
combinations spiral out of control specifically with three features: continuation
lines, “collapsed” block quotes, and new list items.   While I have yet to add proper
testing for new list items, I believe I have decent coverage of the other two features.</p>
<p>Because of continuation lines, I not only have to test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="n">me</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but I have to test three related scenarios: without the first <code>&gt;</code> character, without
the second <code>&gt;</code> character, and without both <code>&gt;</code> characters.</p>
<p>Because of “collapsed” block quotes, I not only have to test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="n">me</span>
</pre></div>
<p>but I have to test:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="n">me</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">test</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span>    <span class="n">me</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And with new list items, it is more that the code I have in place recognizes
that a new list item can set a different starting point for any elements that
are contained within that list item’s scope.</p>
<p>But in the end, I got it done.  It was long.  It was arduous.  It was painful.
But I got it done.  Now that I
have all those scenario tests and their failures in place, the next thing that I
need to do is to start going through them and cleaning up any failures.</p>
<p>And that is what next week is about!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully, unless my brain falls out through my ears in the meantime, a new year
will mean getting a lot of these issues resolved.
Stay tuned!</p>
