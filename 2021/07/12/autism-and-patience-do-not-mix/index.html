            <p>This past week has been one of the longest weeks that I can remember
in a long time.  To be blunt, I have been sick for almost the entire
week.  And while I am feeling better, I have to acknowledge that my
patience is almost at a breaking point.</p>
<p>Let me explain: I hate being sick.  While I usually take good care of
myself and take breaks and relax when I need to, I do like to keep busy.
[more]</p>
<p>Last weekend was not so different than any other.  We were having some
work done on the house scheduled for the following Wednesday, and those
contractors needed the electrical outlets removed so that they could do
their job.
After talking with my father-in-law, who is a licensed electrician, I
went with the plan that we worked out together and within two hours,
the required work was done.  Working in a relatively hot attic, I was
able to disconnect the required electrical circuits and leave them
safe, all to plan. I double checked with my father-in-law on what I did
and gave him an &ldquo;after action report&rdquo; that he agreed with, and everything
was good.  Knowing I &ldquo;did well&rdquo; according to my father-in-law, I started
working on my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/07/12/markdown-linter-full-of-sound-and-fury/">PyMarkdown project</a>
and got a lot done.  That was possible because it was the Fourth of July,
and as I had Monday off, and I knew that I could write the entire article on Monday.</p>
<p>But Monday arrived rather slowly.  I woke up with a headache that just wouldn&rsquo;t
go away, and a lethargy that I couldn&rsquo;t shake.  I started writing the
article and got it mostly completed, but each paragraph that I put
into that article seemed twice as hard as the one before it.  By the time four o-clock
rolled around, I just knew that I was going to miss my usual Monday 11:59 PM
deadline.  I will spare you the details of how it progressed except to say
that it landed me in the local Emergency Room at 10:00 PM that evening.
Being sent home after five hours, the only thing the doctor and I could
figure out that there was something in the attic that got into my system and
made me react to it.  Whether it was the heat or some old insulation
didn&rsquo;t matter, I reacted to it in a bad way.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning I called into work, letting them know what happened and
that I needed an extra day to try and get better.  Wednesday arrived and
I completed my work for the day, but not without a decent nap in the middle
of the day and another nap after work.  Thursday was better in that I did not need the
afternoon nap, but it was Friday before I needed no nap.  But after
completing work each day, I literally did not do any of the things that
I would normaly do in the evening.  Today, Saturday, is the first day since
Sunday that I have been able to do anything on the computer that was not
work related.  And it really has been taxing my patience.</p>
<hr />
<p>You see, part of my Autism diagnosis is anxiety related.  The best way to
explain my anxiety disorder is that my mind starts to evaluate the different
scenarios that can occur, taking up more and more bandwidth in my brain until
I am overwhelmed.  Depending on who and what is involved in any scenario,
I can often prune some of those scenarios as being unrealistic or unlikely.
But without a neurotypical person&rsquo;s point of view, any pruning that is related
to social circumstances or another person&rsquo;s emotional states is severely
limited.  And that is where the anxiety builds more and more.</p>
<p>To help address that anxiety, I have found two patterns that usually work
very well together: overcommunication and consistency.  If I am working
with you, I will probably tell you something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I have Autism and I tend to overcommunicate.  If it gets to be too
much, please work with me to help us find a good level of communication.
I am also open, honest, and straight forward, so please let me know
if I say something wrong, as it is probably an oversight on my part.
I know I am probably going to miss something, and I hope you will
work with me to get it out in the open, dealt with it, and move on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, that is the overcommunication in a nutshell.  Most of the time,
people ask questions they have, and we have a good conversation about
communication.</p>
<p>The consistency is the other part of my coping mechanism.  I do not
feel the need to be as rigid as others with Autism, but I still
need structure.  I try and plan out the following day before I go to
bed, just getting a high level point of view on what I need to do the
next day.  For work days, that usually means a block of &ldquo;work&rdquo;
followed by walking our dog Bruce, taking a shower, relaxing for an
hour watching something, making dinner, and then some work in the evening
on a project.  For a non-work day, that usually means some work on a project
until noon, doing work around the house or spending time with my wife in
the afternoon, and then following a similar evening pattern to a work day.</p>
<p>If that sounds obsessive, it is not meant to be.  Based on the amount of
analysis that my mind constantly does, that planning strives to quiet
some of those analytics down.  Unless there is a good reason not to, I know
I am going to walk Bruce every day.  I do not need to analyze it that much.
If anything, it relaxes me to know that it is a constant and that me and
Bruce will have a good two mile walk together every day.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that is where my lack of patience and this week have collided with
each other like two freight trains on a single track.  </p>
<p>On the communication
front, if I usually think with the bandwidth of a six-lane highway, I
was probably thinking like I was done to only one lane, and there was
construction being performed on that lane.  On the consistency front,
my entire schedule was destroyed and replaced with a &ldquo;whatever I have
the energy for&rdquo; schedule.</p>
