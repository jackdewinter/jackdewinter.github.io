            <p>This past week has felt like one of the longest weeks that I can remember
in a long time.  To be blunt, I have been sick for almost the entire
week.  And while I am feeling better, I acknowledge that my
patience is almost at a breaking point.</p>
<p>Let me explain: I hate being sick.  I do not personally know of any
people that enjoy being sick, but I really hate being sick.  And I am
not talking about low-level and medium-level headaches.  I get those
frequently and usually work through them while only barely acknowledging
them.  I am talking about being sick to the point of altering my normal
routine just to get through the day.</p>
<p>To compensate, when I am not sick, I try to take good care of myself, eating
healthy foods, drinking lots of water, taking breaks, and relaxing when I
need to.  I am keenly aware that if I do not take care
of myself, the things I cherish in my life will start to fall apart.  One of
those things that helps me take care of myself is to keep busy.  I like to
look back at the past week and know that I have accomplished something that I feel
was useful.  It is not out of fear that I have this work ethic, just a
personal drive to effect positive change, even small change.  Knowing that
I have made a positive change, no matter how small, helps me find peace with
myself and helps me to keep moving forward, despite whatever is thrown in my
way.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the start of last weekend, it looked like any other weekend with some
small tasks around the house to take care of.  One of those tasks was to
remove some electrical outlets in our dining room.  We were having some work done
on the house scheduled for the following Wednesday, and the contractors
needed some electrical outlets removed.
After talking with my father-in-law (a licensed electrician) on Saturday, Sunday was
reserved to work the plan that we made together. After two hours of solid work, the
required changes were done.  Working in a relatively hot attic, I was
able to disconnect the required electrical circuits and leave them
safe, all according to plan. I double checked with my father-in-law on what I did,
gave him an &ldquo;after action report&rdquo; that he okayed, and everything was good.  Knowing
that my father-in-law signed off on my work, I started working on my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/07/12/markdown-linter-full-of-sound-and-fury/">PyMarkdown project</a>
that Sunday afternoon, and got a lot of work done.</p>
<p>But Monday was another story.  It arrived rather slowly.  I woke up with a
headache that just would not go away, and a lethargy that I could not shake.  I
started writing my weekly article and got it mostly completed, but each paragraph
that I put into that article seemed twice as hard to write as the one before it.  By
the time 4:00 PM
rolled around, I just knew that I was going to miss my usual Monday 11:59 PM
deadline.  I will spare you the details of how things progressed except to say
that it landed me in the local Emergency Room at 10:00 PM that evening.
Being sent home after five hours, the only thing the doctor and I could
figure out was that I had reacted badly to something in that attic.  Whether it was
the heat, or some old insulation did not matter, I just reacted to it in a bad way.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning I called into work, letting them know what happened and
that I needed an extra day to try and get better.  Wednesday arrived and
I completed my work for the day, but not without a decent nap in the middle
of the day and another nap after work.  Thursday was better in that I did not need the
afternoon nap, but it was Friday before I needed no nap.  But after
completing work each day, I literally did not do any of the things that
I would normally do in the evening.  Today, Saturday, is the first day since
Sunday that I have been able to do anything on the computer that was not
work related.  And it really has been taxing my patience.</p>
<hr />
<p>You see, part of my Autism diagnosis is anxiety related.  The best way to
explain my anxiety disorder is that my mind starts to evaluate the different
scenarios that can occur, taking up more and more bandwidth in my brain until
I am overwhelmed.  Depending on who and what is involved in any scenario,
I can often prune some of those scenarios as being unrealistic or unlikely. With
each branch of scenarios that I prune, a proportional amount of anxiety is
released. But without a neurotypical person&rsquo;s point of view, any pruning that
is related to social circumstances or another person&rsquo;s emotional states is severely
limited.  And that is where the anxiety builds more and more.</p>
<p>To help address my anxiety, I have found two patterns that usually work
very well together: overcommunication and consistency.  If I am working
with you for anything more than an hour or so, I will probably tell you
something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I have Autism and I tend to overcommunicate.  If it gets to be too
much, please work with me to help us find a good level of communication.
I am also open, honest, and straight forward, so please let me know
if I say something wrong, as it is probably an oversight on my part.
I know I am probably going to miss something, and I hope you will
work with me to get it out in the open, dealt with it, and move on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, that is an example of overcommunication in a nutshell.  The good
news is that most of the time people ask any questions they have, and we
proceed with a good conversation about communication.  Sometimes those questions
are asked right away and sometimes those questions are asked weeks later.
From my point of view, the good news is that it helps people know that
I am okay talking about it.</p>
<p>Consistency is the other part of my coping mechanism.  I do not
feel the need to be as rigid as others with Autism, but I still find
that structure helps.  I try and plan out the following day before I go to
bed, just getting a high-level point of view on what I want to accomplish
on the next day.  For workdays, that usually means a block of &ldquo;work&rdquo;
followed by walking our dog Bruce, taking a shower, relaxing for an
hour watching something, making dinner, and then some work in the evening
on a project.  For a non-workday, that usually means some work on a project
until noon, doing work around the house or spending time with my wife in
the afternoon, and then following a similar evening pattern to a workday.</p>
<p>If that sounds obsessive, it is not meant to be.  Based on the amount of
analysis that my mind constantly does, that planning helps to quiet
some of my analytics down.  Unless there is a good reason not to, I know
I am going to walk our dog Bruce every day.  I do not need to analyze it
that much. If anything, it relaxes me to know that it is a constant and that me and
Bruce will have a good two mile walk together every day.  I also have
a good reason to expect that my wife and I will do the shopping for the
week on a Saturday.  It is not set in stone when we leave, but I do know
that we almost always do the shopping on that day.  And if we decide to
move it around to another day, we just talk about it ahead of time.</p>
<p>While those were just two examples, there are many more.  I have
worked on learning to accept a certain amount of change within those groups of
actions.  If I have adequate time to adjust, I am okay with a couple
of those actions occurring or being delayed to another day.  But those
kinds of adjustments took me years to learn, and the fewer the things
that need adjusting the better.</p>
<hr />
<p>And that is where my lack of patience and this week have collided with
each other like two freight trains on a single track.  </p>
<p>On the communication front, if everyone usually thinks with the bandwidth
of a multi-lane highway, I was probably operating like I was down to only
having one lane of that highway available, with construction being performed
on that lane.  On the consistency front, my entire schedule was
destroyed and replaced with a &ldquo;whatever I have the energy for&rdquo; schedule.</p>
<p>Between my two primary coping mechanisms being effectively disabled, it was
a nightmare.  I wanted to be able to communicate to those around me with my
normal level of communication, but it just was not there.  As for the consistency
in my schedule, I would have had more consistency rolling at set of dice to
decide what I was going to do each day.  With both coping mechanisms
non-functional, the only good news was that I was too tired to care.</p>
<p>So yes, I was very grumpy for most of the week.  Or so I thought.  It turns
out that while I still have the same low level of patience with myself that
I always have, I have fostered more patience in others with respect to
myself.  I felt I was grumpy enough to warrant &ldquo;the evil eye daggers&rdquo;
from my wife.<sup id="fnref:dagger"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dagger">1</a></sup>  And I felt like I had warranted at least a dozen of them.</p>
<p>But after I told my wife this, she looked at me with a quizzical look
on her face.  She went on to explain that when she is not feeling well,
I give her extra space to account for her own form of grumpiness.  She
also talked to me about how we both are harder on ourselves than with
other people.  I was about to argue with her, but two things stopped me.
First, she was right.  Second, I was too tired to argue.</p>
<p>You see, the person that I trust to have a more accurate picture of
myself just told me that it was okay.  She knew that it was just a
short-term behavior change and that I would be back to my normal self
as soon as I could manage it.  She had the patience to wait until that
happened.</p>
<hr />
<p>Being patient with yourself is not a skill that come to many of us naturally.
Most people must practice it repeatedly to get close to inner peace,
if not achieve it.  Even more difficult is finding that patience within
yourself despite trying personal circumstances.  And when I say, &ldquo;achieve peace&rdquo;,
I mean being able to find it with work, not that it just mystically appears.</p>
<p>While those statements are generally true of most people, it is magnified
for many people with a disability.  Regardless of how that disability affects
your life, you know you must try harder than the people around you to get
things done.  Having your copying mechanisms temporarily disabled because you
are sick is a trying personal circumstance in my mind.</p>
<p>But during those times, I am working towards my own understanding.  The idea
that while I may feel like a total mess on the inside, I am still capable of
projecting the same patience to myself that I do to others.  As an old friend
once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way to convince someone that you are not all talk is to practice
what you are preaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is what I am working towards.  Affording myself the same patience
that I give to others.  Letting myself know that it is okay to talk some
time to recover from being sick.  Allowing myself to get better, at whatever
pace my body decides it wants to take.  And with all that, the patience
to know that I will probably not get it right on the first try, but it is
taking those small steps forward that count.</p>
