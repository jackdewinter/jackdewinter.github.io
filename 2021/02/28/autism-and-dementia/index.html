            <p>When I started writing these articles, I intended to write one article every month to
help people with and without Autism understand what goes on in my mind.  By exposing how
my Autism affects me, my hope is that each reader will be able to apply some small portion
of what they read in these articles.  Every person with Autism manifests their Autism
differently from everyone else.  As such, having a goal of helping everyone with any
connection to Autism would be a tough goal to achieve.  My more modest goal is that each
article will have some impact on at least one person&rsquo;s life.  Maybe it helps someone to
understand a loved one, it encourages someone to be a little kinder to someone with Autism
in their life, or it causes someone to take a minute to read the article and then think
about it. That is why I write these articles, to ignite that spark in my readers.</p>
<p>You see, that is how I was raised.  I have a great mother who raised three children on
her own starting in the late 1970s - a time where a decision like that was not very
popular.  Over the years, we have talked about the reasons why she did that, and her
response always remained the same: &ldquo;I love you kids, and I knew it
would be hard, but I also knew that I could do it.  So, I did it.&rdquo;  From there, it was
always a solid talk about how her faith in God, as a Roman Catholic, helped her in the
tough times.  There is always a mention of how we often threw roadblocks in her way,
which all three of us blush or laugh at when they are now mentioned.
Outshining all of that, was the firm statement from my mother that, through it
all, her love for us never faltered. And in return, all us kids had one extra best friend
in our lives.</p>
<p>We were not the only ones that she affected.  By continuing to be involved in her
church, she was fortunate enough to meet, fall in love with, and marry her second
husband, Gerry.  She loved Gerry&rsquo;s kids as her own, often speaking of his kids and his
grandkids with the same love that she has for her own
grandkids.</p>
<p>Giving back was so wired into her system, that she found a job working
with the Red Cross to provide aide to the elderly, by helping them with everyday things
that they could no longer do.  When we heard stories of the people she helped,
it would be easy to believe that those people were related to our family by
the way my mother talked about them.  Not one to be idle, in her off hours it was rare
that she was not sitting in her favorite chair sewing or knitting.  She used those skills
to make doll clothes for children in need, and baby blankets for newborns at the local
hospital.  Once again, when I asked, she would say that
it kept her busy and that she was giving back to a community that had helped her when
she needed it.  So, she did it.</p>
<p>It is because of this, that I have started writing these articles and writing in general.
As someone with Autism, I cannot help everyone out there, but perhaps I can help get some
manner of message to some of the people that need it and do my bit to help.  Write the
next great
science fiction novel?  Tried that and failed miserably.  Invent some new software that
will revolutionize the way we do something?  Tried that and did decently okay back in the
1990s.  Write from my heart about how my Autism affects me?  To echo what my mother said
with my own spin: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to be easy, and I know being vulnerable is hard, but
I know I can do it.  So, I did it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But that bedrock of my life, my mother, is now faltering.  After 75+ years of her life,
my mother is being attacked by the disease known as dementia.  Its effects are brutal.
There was a time when I could pick up the phone and have a good 30-minute conversation
with one of my best friends, now we struggle to have a 30 second conversation that is
coherent.  In the past, we used to laugh at all the stupid things I did as a kid,
now, I try to hold back the tears as I tell my brother and sister about the calls I
have had with my mom.  Instead of talking about our next family gathering with
Mom and all three sibilings, we end up talking about funeral plans and how
we know she is in pain while she is losing her mind.</p>
<p>The last decent conversation I remember having with my mother is in August, right after
my son&rsquo;s birthday.  It was a bit sketchy in places, and it was obvious that some of her
long-term memory was going, but it was a good conversation.  Every two or three weeks
after that, some element of the conversation dropped away.  It was as if someone was taking
the color out of my mother&rsquo;s life bit-by-bit, and the struggle in her voice to form
sentences was obvious.  After that, it was harder to call her.  I knew that when I called,
it would hang over me like a dark cloud for the next couple of days.  I started making
excuses as to why I could not call her, convincing myself it was for the better.  I was
just scared.  I was losing my best friend.</p>
<p>This really hit home just after New Year&rsquo;s Day when I called her to wish her a happy
new year.  I wish I could relate to you what that conversation was about, but I honestly
do not have a clue about it myself.  I asked her how she was doing, and she said she was
sad.  And then she mentioned something about children and red and a couple of other things
I could not understand.  Talking with my sister later, she mentioned that she must be
having a good day that I was able to get 1 or 2 coherent minutes out of her.  Most days, my
sister was struggling with her to even get that.  </p>
<p>That really threw me.  I tried writing an article about Autism after that call, but
nothing came out.  Every time I started to write, I wrote one sentence and stared at the
screen for 15 minutes before giving up.  In each case, I always went back to thinking
about Mom and her dementia.  After a good solid six weeks of repeating that process and
getting nowhere, I had a &ldquo;lightbulb&rdquo; moment.  It was then, that I realized that this was
also affecting me on another level, a more personal level.  I was afraid for me.</p>
<p>Autism by itself is no walk in the park.  Sure, I have learned to mitigate a lot of it,
but it still a lot of work.  I was lucky to find a second wife later in life, who takes
the time to understand me.  In return, she reasonably asks me to understand her quirks
and accept her for who she is.  Our conversations often reminds me of my conversations
with my mother as I was growing up, trying to figure things out.  Now, instead of being
able to share my happiness with my mother, I see how quickly my mother&rsquo;s dementia is
removing most of the woman that I knew, admired, and loved.  That&rsquo;s chilling.</p>
<p>You see, as someone with Autism, I have spent my life working on my communication skills
and overcoming a lack of social skills by using the positive aspects of my Autism to
compensate.  Back in August, when my mother&rsquo;s dementia was getting worse, I looked up
the definition of dementia on the
<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013">Mayo Clinic&rsquo;s website</a>,
and it looked like it was tailor made as a nasty list for people with Autism.  In the
Cognitive part of the list, it talks about “difficulty” items. Most people with Autism
struggle with all/some of these “difficulty” items and, if they are lucky, can find ways
to compensate for all/some of those items.  The thought of losing some of my ability
to mitigate my Autism sucks.  The <em>Psychological Changes</em> part of the list is not much
better.  To be truthful, I know that my Autism has caused me to experience at least
4 out of the 7 things on that list in some form.  It is only by working hard and trusting
in my doctor, my psychologist, and my friends that I now keep their influence down to a
bare minimum.  But if they get worse?</p>
<p>For me, part of having Autism is being hyper-aware of things around me.  It is hard to
miss things when you brain is busy analyzing things for most of your life.  At 52
years of age, I am noticing that I am forgetting some little things here and there, mostly
short-term stuff.  There are times where I have difficulty in finding the right words to
communicate something, only for the word that I am looking for to be something simple.
And as funny as it sounds, I am forgetting where I placed my keys more often these days,
something that almost never happened in the past.  And with what my mother is going
through, I sometimes wonder if I am getting some early tinges of dementia, or if this
is just normal&hellip; or at least as normal as a person with Autism can get.</p>
<p>But I am not one to wallow, I am one to get out there and do stuff.  I know I get knocked
down from time to time, but I also know that I am not alone.  My family, in their own
unique ways, helps to give me the courage to dust myself off and stand up again.</p>
<p>Am I worried about my mother?  Yes.  But the only thing I can do there is to try and call
her to let her know I am here, and to send peaceful thoughts her way.</p>
<p>Am I still worried that the same thing that is afflicting my mother will one day afflict
me?  Yes.  But I hopefully have some time before that happens, I can look for positive
actions that I can do to help me combat this disease.</p>
<p>Does my writing help me as much as it helps others?  Yes.  For me, I think that my
writing helps me as much as others by acting like my own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a>.
It hurts to talk about things sometimes, but if I can help one person in some way, it
is good enough for me.</p>
<p>So, I did it.</p>
