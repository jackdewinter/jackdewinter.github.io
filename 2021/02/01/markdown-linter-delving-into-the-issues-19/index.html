<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/01/25/markdown-linter-delving-into-the-issues-18/">last article</a>, I documented how
I was working hard to get to the end of the unprioritized items in my issues list
and on to the prioritized parts of the list.  This article details the work that
I am performing to get to the end of the unprioritized list.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I started the week with one goal on my mind: to clear out any unprioritized items so that
I can start working on the prioritized items next week.  I knew that goal might not be
achievable, but that was okay for me.  It was something concrete that I could work towards.
Possibly achievable and concrete… sounded good to me!</p>
<p>Internally, I was fighting a different battle.  I knew that I had some work to do to
finish off the unprioritized items. I knew that I also had some clearly defined priorities
that I had listed in the issues list.  But in the process of prioritizing items, I missed
the sections that occur after the <code>Bugs - Tabs</code> section.  While not everything would be
actionable right away, I did need to take the time to figure out when those
sections will be handled.  Not having a plan with the release getting closer was just
getting to me.</p>
<p>At the very least, I know that I could wait with a concrete decision on that question
until after all the unprioritized items were resolved, so off I went!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the
commits between

<h2 id="the-big-push">The Big Push!<a class="headerlink" href="#the-big-push" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From the number of items in the issues list that were not prioritized, I knew that if I
focused for between a couple of days and a week, I could get every unprioritized item
resolved.  It was time for a big push!  </p>
<h3 id="yet-more-fun-with-link-reference-definitions">Yet More Fun With Link Reference Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#yet-more-fun-with-link-reference-definitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>It seems like I cannot get away from issues involving Link Reference Definitions, but
I was going to try by resolving this issue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">dedup</span> <span class="o">`</span><span class="n">append_text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">`</span>
<span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_reference_links_extra_03h</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">03</span><span class="n">hc</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After consultation with the people on the
<a href="https://talk.commonmark.org/t/hard-line-breaks-and-link-reference-definitions/3755">CommonMark forums</a>,
I decided to double-down on my decision from last week to implement code that follows
the CommonMark reference implementation.  While I did get agreement that the Markdown
from function <code>test_reference_links_extra_03h</code> should parse as a valid Link Reference
Definition, the current version of CommonMark (0.29.2) does not support that.  As such,
I had to make sure that the PyMarkdown parser does not support that.</p>
<p>After adding a few extra test functions to make sure I had covered all the scenarios,
I started debugging and found the issue almost immediately.  In processing the line
within the Link Reference Definition using the <code>__is_link_reference_definition</code> function,
the function was always finding that the Link Reference Definition was valid, including
when it ended with the Hard Line Break elements backslash <code>\</code> character.  Adding some
extra code to the <code>__is_link_reference_definition</code> function solved that issue, only to
show another issue.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, a line can end with an escaped backslash character, such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">bar</span><span class="err">\\</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">uri</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In this case, the final backslash is escaped, and is represented in the token by
the Python string <code>bar\\\b\\\nfoo</code>.  As Python escapes a backslash with another
backslash, that string is effectively read as the text <code>bar</code>, an escaped backslash <code>\\</code>,
a backspace special character <code>\b</code>, another escaped backslash <code>\\</code>, the newline character,
and finally the text <code>foo</code>.  As I have mentioned in previous articles regarding the
project’s use of the backspace character, the first escaped backslash will be countered by
the backspace character, effectively leaving a single backslash followed by a newline
character as the most interesting character sequences in that string.  While it can be
a bit confusing to read (even to me sometimes!), that encoding allows a process to decide
whether to look at that string in its original Markdown form or in its target HTML form.</p>
<p>While that interpretation of the sequence is correct, the parser needed to be changed
to prevent that particular end-of-line sequence from being recognized as a
Hard Line Break element.  That sequence was not really a <code>\</code> character at the end of the
line, it was an escaped <code>\</code> character at the end of the line.
Having identified the issue, I quick worked to modify the <code>handle_line_end</code>
function to verify that the characters before a backslash at the end of the line were
not the sequence <code>\\\b</code>.  After running the tests a couple of times and performing
some extra verification steps to make sure I got it right, it was on to the next issue.</p>
<h2 id="link-reference-definitions-and-list-boundaries">Link Reference Definitions and List Boundaries<a class="headerlink" href="#link-reference-definitions-and-list-boundaries" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the goal of resolving this item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_link_reference_definitions_extra_01c</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I enabled test function <code>test_link_reference_definitions_extra_01c</code> and added a new
test function <code>test_link_reference_definitions_extra_01d</code>.  Then I started looking at
the test examples, and I realized that I needed to think carefully about them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>I knew it was a Link Reference Definition that should be broken, but I was not 100% sure
why it was broken.  Working through it on paper, I got the concrete answer that I needed.
At the end of line 1, the parser has a
single list started, with a partial Link Reference Definition active.  However, when the
second line starts with a character that is not part of a valid Link Reference Definition,
the processing is rewound, and the first line is reinterpreted as plaintext.  From there,
it becomes a single list with two list items, each list item containing half of the
“almost” Link Reference Definition.</p>
<p>With that research in hand, I started debugging and realized two things.  The first was
that the <code>caller_can_handle_requeue</code> argument on the <code>close_open_blocks_fn</code> function
was not set to <code>True</code>.  This meant that the Link Reference Definitions would never be
closed by that function.  When I addressed that issue, I found the second thing: turning
that flag on and supporting the rewind or requeue from that point required a lot of
argument passing.  While I didn’t have a lot of time to address it now, I made sure
that there was something in the issues list about addressing the issue of passing too
many arguments along and moved on.</p>
<h2 id="link-reference-definitions-and-block-quote-boundaries">Link Reference Definitions and Block Quote Boundaries<a class="headerlink" href="#link-reference-definitions-and-block-quote-boundaries" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Being in the same area as with Link Reference Definitions and List Boundaries, I figured
that dealing with this item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_link_reference_definitions_extra_02b</span>
</pre></div>
<p>was a good use of my time.  The research for this item almost followed the exact same path
that my research had followed for List Blocks.  The only difference was that they
were working on Block Quote boundaries instead of List boundaries.  Using the same
manner of fixing this issue for Block Quotes as I used for List Blocks, this issue was
quickly fixed.  This fix also carried over to the next issue that I addressed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">add</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="k">c</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">increases</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quotes</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">LRD</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As a matter of fact, I did not have to add any extra code to the parser above the code
that I originally added for function <code>test_link_reference_definitions_extra_02b</code>.</p>
<p>But having seen that I missed on a number of these scenarios involving non-paragraph
Leaf Block elements, I wanted to make sure that I had some coverage in there for the
other Leaf Block elements, hence, the issue:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">verify</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">introduces</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quotes</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To address that issue, I added new scenario tests, test function
<code>test_block_quotes_229c</code> to test function <code>test_block_quotes_229j</code>.  I just started with
Indented Code Blocks, proceeded to Fenced Code Blocks, ending up on HTML Code Blocks.
With various variations in place, when I was done there were nine new scenario tests,
with five of those tests being disabled.  I had some work to do!</p>
<h2 id="before-signing-off-for-the-night">Before Signing Off For The Night<a class="headerlink" href="#before-signing-off-for-the-night" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before I shutdown my system for the night, I looked around and noticed that there was
another item that was like the one I had just added tests for:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">links</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">518</span><span class="n">b</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">518</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">inside</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="k">and</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="k">or</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quote</span>
  <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">now</span> <span class="n">test_paragraph_extra_j0</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As I had also forgotten to run Black on my last couple of commits, it was a good chance
to see if I had even more work to do, or if I would get a break and have some good,
positive test karma come my way.  I added test function <code>test_paragraph_extra_j0e</code>
and two variations, one with the same thing in a Block Quote element and the other
with the same thing in a List Block element.  The good news? It worked first time,
with no test needing to be disabled.  It was a good way to end that day!</p>
<h2 id="friday-night-blues">Friday Night Blues<a class="headerlink" href="#friday-night-blues" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As Friday night rolled around, I found that I had some spare time to work on the PyMarkdown
project that evening, but I was less than enthusiastic about it.  It seemed that every
time I worked on the project, I would resolve two or three items from the issues list,
only to add another three or
four items to that same list.  It felt like I was spinning my wheels and getting nowhere.
It took me looking at the specification and the existing scenario tests to realize that
I was just hitting a lot of boundary conditions for Block Quote elements.  At that moment
it dawned on me:  I was not adding hard-to-solve items to the issues list, I was adding
little issues that were, in all honesty, way off the beaten path of Markdown. Not to
sound too negative, but I was dealing with the nit-picky scenarios!  That helped me to
get my mind in the correct perspective!</p>
<p>It was with that renewed sense of purpose that I refocused to work on:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_block_quotes_229d</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">BQ</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">ICB</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Working through the debug logs, I quickly came to an interesting conclusion.  Due to
paragraph continuation lines, most of the existing Block Quote tests would either
maintain or increase their level of Block Quotes, but never decrease.  If one of the
Block Quote start characters was missing within a paragraph, the paragraph continuation
rule would kick in the Block Quote would continue along without any disruptions.</p>
<p>But that was not so with other, non-Paragraph elements.  Focusing on the item that
I was currently working on, I changed the <code>__ensure_stack_at_level</code> function to
properly determine when the stack needed to increase (<code>stack_increase_needed</code>) and
when the stack needed to decrease (<code>stack_decrease_needed</code>).  With that code in place,
I added code to reduce the Block Quote count if needed, closing any open elements
until the proper Block Quote count was reached.</p>
<p>And while a lot of issues I fixed in this time were only with the parser itself, this
issue required changes in the Markdown transformer.  It was not anything big, but to
make sure that the Block Quote token’s <code>leading_text_index</code> field was properly maintained,
the <code>__rehydrate_block_quote</code> function and the <code>__rehydrate_block_quote_end</code> function
needed to properly increase that variable if needed.  After a bit of fiddling and
verification to make sure that everything was once again passing, it was off to
relax before a long day on Saturday.</p>
<h2 id="saturdays-slog">Saturday’s Slog<a class="headerlink" href="#saturdays-slog" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Knowing that I would have a big chunk of time on Saturday, I resolved to myself to push
hard to see if I could get to the end of the unprioritized list by the end of the day.  In
my mind, I was not sure if I would be able to do it, but I figured a good push to resolve
issues wouldn’t hurt either way.  With that, and some loud music in the background,
I hunkered down and got to work.</p>
<h3 id="block-quotes-and-html-blocks">Block Quotes and HTML Blocks<a class="headerlink" href="#block-quotes-and-html-blocks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having had good success with Indented Code Blocks and Block Quotes the night before,
I decided to just power ahead and deal with this item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_block_quotes_229i</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">test_block_quotes_229j</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">BQ</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">HTML</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Doing some testing against BabelMark, I soon found out that unlike the Indented Code
Block element, HTML Code Blocks inside of a Block Quote element treated any extra
Block Quote start characters as Code Block text.  Looking over the GFM specification
and thinking about it a bit, this made sense to me.  The HTML Code Block has five different
start sequences and five matching close sequences.  Other than the Block Quote sequences
that were in place when it started, unless it matched one of those close sequences,
it would just treat any increases as text that was a part of the Code Block itself.
But that wasn’t how the parser was interpreting it. It was trying to open a new
Block Quote when it saw the extra Block Quote prefix character.</p>
<p>To address this, I had to modify the <code>__count_block_quote_starts</code> function to recognize
that situation, and then respond to that with changes in the
<code>__get_nested_container_starts</code> function to ignore a change in Block Quote starts.
With those changes in place, enabling test function <code>test_block_quotes_229j</code> was trivial,
modifying this piece of code from the function <code>__ensure_stack_at_level</code> from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">stack_decrease_needed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">top_token_on_stack</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_indented_code_block</span>

<p>Running the tests, the scenario tests now passed, and it was on to the next item.</p>
<h2 id="two-code-blocks-down">Two Code Blocks Down…<a class="headerlink" href="#two-code-blocks-down" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>And one type of code block left to deal with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">test_block_quotes_229g</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">test_block_quotes_229h</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">BQ</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">FCB</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While I would love to say that fixing these tests just required one or two lines of
code, that would be dishonest.  Because the processing of the Fenced Code Block elements
is sufficiently different from the other Code Blocks, the handling of it in the
<code>__handle_block_quote_section</code> function was separate from the other token types.  But
while I had to repeat changes that were like the ones made for Indented Code Blocks
and HTML Code Blocks, it was very beneficial to have them to use as templates.  I
effectively used them to shortcut my debugging processes, getting both tests working
in what I would consider record time!</p>
<h2 id="just-to-be-sure">Just To Be Sure<a class="headerlink" href="#just-to-be-sure" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I was confident that I had properly addressed all the issues that had been raised so far,
but I was also concerned that I was being shortsighted.  So, at that time, I added
the item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">multiple</span> <span class="n">levels</span> <span class="n">up</span> <span class="k">and</span> <span class="n">down</span> <span class="n">over</span> <span class="k">all</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quote</span> <span class="n">transitions</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When I re-read that item before starting to work on it, I clearly understood that it
was to question whether I
had coded the Block Quote transitions for the “plus one” cases or the “plus any” cases.  I
realize that it may not seem like a large difference to others, but I was concerned that I
had used an <code>if</code> statement and checked at one level instead of using a <code>while</code> statement,
checking until multiple levels had been processed.  </p>
<p>After adding 10 new tests that did multiple increases and multiple decreases within
various Leaf Block elements, I held my breath and ran the scenario tests.  Did I get all
the cases the first time around?  How many did I miss?  Was the work to correct them
going to be difficult or easy to complete?  I just wanted to get this done.</p>
<p>Having worked myself up over a possible lengthy set of fixes, I was pleased to find out
that only one change was required.  In the <code>__adjust_paragraph_for_block_quotes</code> function,
I had coded a check to look for a Block Quote end token that was preceded by a Fenced
Code Block end token.  While the purpose of the check remained the same, I needed to
adjust it a bit for a case of multiple Block Quote transitions.  That check went from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">token_document</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_end</span>
        <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">token_document</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_fenced_code_block_end</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">number_of_block_quotes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="n">end_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token_document</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="p">):</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Other than that change, which took approximately 10 minutes to debug and implement,
all the other tests passed without requiring any changes.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-unprioritized-item">The Last Unprioritized Item<a class="headerlink" href="#the-last-unprioritized-item" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point, there was only one item left in the <code>Uncategorized</code> section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">single</span> <span class="k">level</span> <span class="n">up</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="n">down</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">list</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Like the work done in the last section, I believe this was a reminder to myself
to not forget that List Blocks can also be encapsulated within a Block Quote block.
So, with the learnings of the past two sections in mind, I put together a series of
four new scenario tests for List Blocks within Block Quotes and ran the tests without
thinking about it.  They all worked on the first try, with no other changes required
in the project!  It was a good end to this series of work!</p>
<h3 id="and-done">And… Done!<a class="headerlink" href="#and-done" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>And it was with that commit that I finished working on the unprioritized items in the
issues list.  From here on, it was getting prioritized items out of the way for the
release!</p>
<h2 id="starting-on-prioritized-issues">Starting On Prioritized Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-on-prioritized-issues" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having spent a lot of my mental capital to get to this point in the project, I was
explicitly looking for some issues that were
<a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/low-hanging+fruit">low hanging fruits</a>.
While I knew that there were some bulkier items to deal with in the list, i wanted to try
and clear some of the light issues away to get a clearer picture of what was left.</p>
<h2 id="some-simple-research">Some Simple Research<a class="headerlink" href="#some-simple-research" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Intending to start with something simple, this item seemed like a good fit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">where</span> <span class="nv">is</span> `<span class="nv">elif</span> <span class="nv">starting_whitespace</span>:` <span class="nv">used</span>? <span class="nv">why</span>? <span class="nv">better</span> <span class="nv">way</span> <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="nv">it</span>?
</pre></div>
<p>Thinking way back to when I added this, I remember wondering why I needed to do this in
addition to the other code in this function, and what effect it has.  To be honest, I
have written a lot of code for the PyMarkdown project in the last year.  While I try and
be clear with everything I write, I dropped the ball on this one.  Time to figure it out!</p>
<p>Digging into this issue, I searched for the text <code>elif starting_whitespace:</code> and replaced
that string with <code>elif False and starting_whitespace:</code>.  After running the scenario tests,
I picked one of the failures at random, test function <code>test_atx_headings_extra_42</code> and
looked at the failure.  As soon as I started looking at the test output, memories of this
change came flooding back to me.  Within an Atx Heading Element, there is at least one
space character between the start character (<code>#</code>) and the text in the heading.  The HTML
output that is generated is fine, but when the Markdown transformer tries to reconstruct
the original Markdown, that leading space is not represented in the tokens.  To address
that issue, in those cases where it is not otherwise present in the list of tokens,
that code kicks in and adds a Text token with the right markers to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Experimenting with three or four alternate solutions to the issue, only one of those
solutions worked, and it was a lot more convoluted than the existing solution.  If there
is no text to create a Text token with that the parser can attach some extra whitespace to,
then create a Text token specially to hold that extra whitespace.  Basically, it
was good that I thought I could do better, but I already had the best solution for
the job!</p>
<h3 id="dealing-with-multiply-defined-link-reference-definitions">Dealing With Multiply Defined Link Reference Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#dealing-with-multiply-defined-link-reference-definitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having thought about the item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">Link_helper</span>.<span class="nv">py</span><span class="sc">#86</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">link</span> <span class="nv">already</span> <span class="nv">registered</span>, <span class="nv">should</span> <span class="nv">warn</span>?
</pre></div>
<p>at length, resolving it was easy.  While I could add something specific to deal with
that one case, it made more sense to just add a rule to deal with that case.  After a quick
check to verify that the <code>LinkReferenceDefinitionMarkdownToken</code> class has a
<code>did_add_definition</code> field, I resolved this one as done.</p>
<h2 id="picking-another-easy-one">Picking Another Easy One<a class="headerlink" href="#picking-another-easy-one" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another easy item from the list was the item:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">look</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="nv">cases</span> <span class="nv">where</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="nv">is</span> <span class="nv">used</span>, <span class="nv">and</span> <span class="nv">convert</span> <span class="nv">to</span> <span class="nv">whitespace</span> <span class="nv">helper</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This refactor was so easy, I almost feel that it is a waste talking about it.  Like the
replacement of the <code>\n</code> character with <code>ParseHelper.newline_character</code>, this
replacement was to replace the space character with <code>ParserHelper.space_character</code> to
make it more visible.  While I was doing that, I noticed that there were a few
cases where I was trying to make those spaces visible using code like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">" "</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s2">s"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To solve that issue, I cloned a copy of the <code>make_value_visible</code> function, calling it
<code>make_whitespace_visible</code>, and moving that code, plus code for the other whitespace
characters <code>\t</code> and <code>\n</code> into that function.  After refactoring the other occurrences
of that text to the use the new function, the work on that item was completed.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up-for-the-night">Wrapping Up For The Night<a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-up-for-the-night" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As I was winding down to spend some time with my family, I wanted a simple task to help
me relax before stopping for the night.  While it was not very productive, I inspected
the code using PyCharm, resolving three very simple issues.  Combined with a full
run of my <code>clean</code> script that runs Black, the changes were minor but useful.  Nothing
spectacular was changed, but it left the code “just that much better” and allowed me
to sign off for the night with a good feeling.  I had reached my goal for the week,
and I had also managed to clean some little things up as well.  A good combination!</p>
<h2 id="sunday-morning-refactoring">Sunday Morning Refactoring<a class="headerlink" href="#sunday-morning-refactoring" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After a long and productive Saturday, I decided to give myself a bit of a pass on the
hard work and resolve some easy “off-the-books” items.  Where possible, I have tried to
adhere to good
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a>
practices, encapsulating data within an object that cleanly encapsulates the purpose
behind the object.  From my experience, the problem with doing this with any kind of
language parser is that
there are often a group of miscenalenous variables that do not cohesively fall under a
single theme.  Often, I find that they are just a loose group of variables that need
to be maintained to get the job done.  Having the same type of problem with the
main processing phase of the PyMarkdown parser, I decided to just go ahead and group
these variables under the <code>ParserState</code> class.</p>
<p>Over three commits, I managed to clarify the usage pattern for the four variables
already in that object.  This was done by adding a <code>__</code> prefix to each of those
variables to ensure that only private usage of that field was allowed.  For external
usage of those variables, I added a new getter property for each variable with the same
name as the original variable.
In this way, I guaranteed that existing code that did not modify those variables would
remain as it was, while strengthening the usage pattern for those variables.
The additional eight variables were moved into the <code>ParserState</code> class following a similar
pattern.  Instead of changing the name of the variable to include a <code>__</code> prefix, the
variable was added to the class with the prefix already added, with the provided getter
function being added with the name of the variable minus the prefix.</p>
<p>With those changes in place, I started to run the tests, and encountered and handful of
cases where the parser needed to change one of those variables during its processing.
In each of those cases, I looked at the code and tried to determine the best
way to set the information to the desired value while minimizing the exposure of that
variable to the rest of the parser.  In the case of the <code>set_no_para_start_if_empty</code>
function, that exposure was just the name of the function, as the body of the function
only sets the <code>__no_para_start_if_empty</code> variable to <code>True</code>.  For the
<code>mark_start_information</code> function, called when the container processor is invoked for a
new line, six of the variables in the class are set to their initial values, keeping any
changes in those variables within the class.  In all
cases, these were what I felt were the most minimal exposure that was needed for
other functions and classes dependent on the <code>ParserState</code> class and its variables.</p>
<h3 id="more-cleanup">More Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#more-cleanup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once those variables were placed within the <code>ParserState</code> class with their getters and
setters, I started going through downstream functions.  In each case, I looked for the name
of one of the variables that I moved into the class and determined if it could be replaced
by a simple reference to the <code>parser_state</code> variable that was used for the current instance
of the <code>ParserState</code> class.  When I could replace it, I simply took the function argument,
say <code>original_stack_depth</code>, and replaced it with <code>parser_state.original_stack_depth</code> where
it was used in the function.  At that point, when I completed that task properly, the
argument would show up as unused, and I would remove it from the function’s argument list,
also removing it from the arguments passed to that function wherever it was called from.
At that point, it was simply another case of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lather,_rinse,_repeat">lather-rinse-repeat</a>
until all non-class references were replaced with class references.</p>
<p>And to be honest, here was where having the solid heft of the scenario tests came in very
handy.  Instead of just praying that I had made the right changes, every couple of changes
was followed with the execution of the complete set of scenario tests.  If there was a
failure, I would investigate and find out the reason why it failed, addressing that issue.
If things were fine, I would stage the changes in Git, allowing me to progress forward with
confidence that I could back out any change at any time.  While this process was a long
process, the confidence that it gave me that I was making the right changes was priceless.
With over 99.5% code coverage, if I messed something up in the refactoring, I found out
about it right away.  </p>
<p>I was making the right changes to clean up the project code, and I was not negatively
impacting the code.  It was good to be able to do both with the security and confidence
of a well-tested project.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking back at the work I did during the week, it was hard not to get jazzed by the
fact that I set a goal to eliminate all non-prioritized items from the issues list.  That
was tampered with the question about what to do with the other sections that I had forgot
about, but it was still a win.  And in its own way, resolving the unprioritized section
of the issues list helped me answer my own question. I would just prioritize them!</p>
<p>The remaining sections are cleanly divided into two groups: features and bugs.  With the
possible exception of front matter<sup id="fnref:front"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:front">1</a></sup>, while the other features would be nice to
have, I didn’t
need any of them for the initial release.  The bugs that remained also divided nicely
into two groups: Tabs and Rules.  As a linter is nothing without some good rules to
show its power, fixing the items in the Rules sections before release was non-negotiable.</p>
<p>The issues in the Tabs section were a different story.  Making sure that the Tab support
was spot on was going to be a sub-project, not something that I wanted
to rush.  Provided that I can come up with an “almost” interim solution for Tabs, I should
be okay. Not great, but okay.  The only reason I have confidence in saying that is because
most people that I know shy away from tab character in their documents and source code,
mostly due to questions on how they are interpreted.  So, while I do have to address Tabs
properly at some point, it doesn’t need to be until after the release.</p>
<p>Getting everything fixed and coming up with a good plan for the rest of the sections was
just what I needed.  Another concrete goal that I can see myself achieving.  And yet
another step closer to the release!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After 19 articles detailing how I was attacking each group of issues, I thought it
would be useful to look back over that effort and determine how things went and lessons
learned.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:front">
<p>Since every article I write has a front matter section to it, I strongly feel that including that one feature into the release should be a priority. <a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:front" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>
