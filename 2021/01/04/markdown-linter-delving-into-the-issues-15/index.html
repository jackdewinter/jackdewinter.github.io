<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/12/28/markdown-linter-delving-into-the-issues-14/">last article</a>,
I continued working on Block Quote issues and issues with Block Quotes and their
interactions with List Blocks.  In this article, I document that work that was done
to address those issues and resolve them.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With a couple of weeks off for the holidays and relatively light “honey-do” schedule
around the house, I was hoping to have some good relaxing days along with some good
productive project days.  In my head, I was mentally starting to evaluate each of the
remaining items in the list, assigning them a priority between 1 (highest) and
4 (lowest).  I knew completing the Block Quote issues and Block Quote adjacent issues
has a priority of 1, but I needed to take some time to think about the others.  And
while I was thinking about those others, it was a good time to get some solid work in!</p>

my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in

<h2 id="creating-a-new-scenario-series">Creating A New Scenario Series<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-new-scenario-series" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After doing a block of work with Block Quotes, I thought it was a good time to start
making a new scenario test group for them, Series N.  To start this new series off, I
simply copied and pasted
example scenarios from other series and began to work through the permutations.  Once
I had those roughly filled out, I created the <code>test_markdown_paragraph_series_n.py</code>
module to hold the scenario tests, and just started working on putting them together.
After I had the first group of tests in Series N filled out, it was almost cut-and-paste
to get the next group of tests ready, with a simple change to the specific Markdown
element I was testing in that group.</p>
<p>As nothing is ever easy (it seems…), I ran into some failures that I needed to fix.
The first set of failures occurred with unquoted HTML Blocks, in that those HTML
Blocks did not end the Block Quote element.  This was quickly followed up by the same
issue occurring with Atx Heading elements.  As I had already solved this problem for
List Blocks, it was quickly fixed by adding checks in the <code>check_for_lazy_handling</code>
function for both the Atx Heading element starting (<code>LeafBlockProcessor.is_atx_heading</code>)
or the HTML Block element starting (<code>HtmlHelper.is_html_block</code>).</p>
<p>At the same time, to handle two extra list-based scenarios, I added the
<code>test_block_quotes_213aa</code> function and <code>test_block_quotes_213ab</code> function as variations
on the <code>test_block_quotes_213a</code> test function.  I tried for a good hour or so to resolve
the issues with all these functions, but I did not make a lot of progress.  In the
end, I got test function <code>test_block_quotes_213ab</code> working, but functions
<code>test_block_quotes_213a</code> and <code>test_block_quotes_213aa</code> just did not want to seem to
work.</p>
<p>My main priority at the time was filling out the Series N set of tests, so I left
those two tests disabled while I proceeded to fill out the Series N tests.  Nothing
exciting to report from that task… it was just a lot of moving, documenting,
checking, and rechecking. You know, the normal stuff.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-those-tests">Addressing Those Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#addressing-those-tests" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>In looking good and hard at those disabled tests, I was able to eventually see that a
good group of those tests were dealing with nested containers.  Specifically, they
were dealing with a Block Quote element inside of a List Block element, or the other
way around. Putting the disabled tests, their Markdown documents, and their
expected tokens under a metaphorical microscope, it was a while before I noticed
something that I had previously missed.  When I followed the examples closely, it
looked like Block Quote elements within
a List Block element were not being properly closed in each example.</p>
<p>In debugging this issue, I added a handful of extra tests to help me analyze the
situation. The Markdown for one of those tests, the <code>test_block_quotes_extra_02a</code> test
function, is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">start</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">quote</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and the list of tokens produced for that Markdown were:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[
    '[block-quote(1,1)::&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; ]',
    '[para(1,3):]',
    '[text(1,3):start:]',
    '[end-para:::True]',
    '[ulist(2,3):-::4:  ]',
    '[para(2,5):]',
    '[text(2,5):quote:]',
    '[end-para:::True]',
    '[BLANK(3,2):]',
    '[para(4,3):]',
    '[text(4,3):end:]',
    '[end-para:::True]',
    '[end-ulist:::True]',
    '[end-block-quote:::True]'
]
</pre></div>
<p>As I worked through the example, following the Markdown document and the parser’s
tokens,
I discovered the issue.  The Blank Line element on line 3 ended the first Paragraph
element, and I was good with that.  But more importantly, because that Paragraph element
was closed due to the Blank Line being encountered, the new text on line 4 was not
eligible to be included as paragraph continuation text.  Based on that information, the
new Paragraph element for line 4 needed to be created outside of the List Block element,
as it did not have the indentation to support being included in the list.</p>
<p>Basically, the end Unordered List Block token was in the wrong place.  To fix it, I would
need to move it above the occurrence of the Blank Line element.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-it-right">Fixing It Right!<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-it-right" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Being an issue with the tokenization of the Markdown Document, I needed to start
with the parser and the <code>BlockQuoteProcessor</code> class.  From the above information, I knew
that I needed to alter the way in which the <code>parser_state.handle_blank_line_fn</code> function
was called, as it was not properly closing the right blocks.  After trying a few
other things, I reverted to a very basic approach to solve the issue:  forgo the
complicated calculations and just do the simple calculation where needed.  So, in the
<code>__handle_block_quote_section</code> function, before the <code>handle_blank_line_fn</code> function is
called, a quick calculation is done to see if the List Block should possibly be closed.
If so, the actual index number is set in the <code>forced_close_until_index</code> variable.  Then,
making a small change to the <code>handle_blank_line_fn</code> function, that variable is passed in
and all tokens on the stack are closed until they get to that point.</p>
<p>At the time, it felt like I was using a large sledgehammer to fix a small problem, but
it worked.  The tokens were being generated properly, and I was able to move on from
there. While I could them go on to describe all the problems I had with the Markdown
transformer, I will spare any reader the pain.  While the basic handling of Block Quote
elements was working
fine, the proper handling of indents within Block Quote elements needed a good solid
day’s overhaul to get it right.  It was a good thing I was on holiday, because I had
that time to devote to working through all the issues and getting the Markdown
rehydration of Block Quotes and their indents just right.</p>
<p>Following that, I expected a lot of issues with the consistency checks, but there was
only one major issue.  In the <code>__validate_new_line</code> function, the <code>leading_text_index</code>
member variable of the Block Quote token was not being updated properly, resulting in
an off-by-one error.  Unlike the problems with the Markdown transformer, this issue
took less than half an hour to find and fix.  Phew!</p>
<p>In the end, I was able to enable four of the <code>test_block_quotes_213</code> test functions
and all five of the new test functions that I had added.  That was a good feeling.</p>
<h3 id="still-missing-one">Still Missing One<a class="headerlink" href="#still-missing-one" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After a good night’s worth of sleep, I got back to tackling the disabled functions,
specifically test function <code>test_block_quotes_213aa</code>.  With a Markdown document of:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">foo</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>   <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">boo</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">bar</span>
</pre></div>
<p>it was immediately obvious that this was somewhat related to the work that I completed
the day before.  It was just figuring out how that stumped me for a while.</p>
<p>Adding some debug, I started to suspect that the “can I start a container block” logic
in the <code>__get_nested_container_starts</code> function was not working properly.  Adding more
specific debugging in that function, my guess was confirmed.  Specifically, there were
cases where I felt it was obvious that a new List Block element should start, but the
code was skipping over those chances.</p>
<p>Stepping through that code, I noticed weird behavior when I got to this part of that
function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="n">nested_ulist_start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ListBlockProcessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_ulist_start</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">nested_olist_start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ListBlockProcessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_olist_start</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">nested_block_start</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BlockQuoteProcessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_start</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Looking at the debug output for that code while debugging the <code>test_block_quotes_213aa</code>
function, it was obvious that on the second line of the document, the code was not
determining that a new block was starting.  It just skipped right over it.</p>
<p>Thinking through the issue while I was debugging, this started to make sense.  It was
not triggering on any of the above start checks because the wrong information was being
presented to it.  In fact, the data presented to it for line 2 of the above Markdown
was literally two space characters followed by the Unsigned List Block start character
(<code>-</code>).  While that specific form of data made sense for the
<code>__get_nested_container_starts</code>
function, trying to invoke any one of the three Container block start functions with
that data would never succeed.  Each of those functions expected the line to at least
be minimally processed, and that line of data clearly had not been.</p>
<p>Trying the simple approach first, I tested the following change while debugging function
<code>test_block_quotes_213aa</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="n">after_ws_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ex_whitespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extract_whitespace</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>

        <span class="n">nested_ulist_start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ListBlockProcessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_ulist_start</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">parser_state</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">after_ws_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ex_whitespace</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and it worked!  Debugging through the test again, that processing allowed the
<code>is_ulist_start</code> to work with the processed line data, resulting in a non-None
result being returned.  After applying that same change to the other two start Container
block functions, I ran the tests again and everything was good.  The tests were passing
without any additional changes being required of the Markdown transformer or the
consistency checks.  I was stoked!</p>
<h2 id="making-the-test-invocation-more-efficient">Making the Test Invocation More Efficient<a class="headerlink" href="#making-the-test-invocation-more-efficient" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I was making the changes to all these scenario tests, one thing was becoming
obvious to me: I was not changing the call pattern.  In the beginning of the project, I
was concerned that I was going to have a wide array of ways to invoke the scenario tests
based on need.  While it was a valid concern at the time, it had not played out that
way.  For each scenario test, I was always adding the following boilerplate code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="c1"># Act</span>
    <span class="n">actual_tokens</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tokenizer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_markdown</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">actual_gfm</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">transformer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="c1"># Assert</span>
    <span class="n">assert_if_lists_different</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expected_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">assert_if_strings_different</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expected_gfm</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual_gfm</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">assert_token_consistency</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_markdown</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While those seven lines are not a lot, over the course of approximately 2,000 scenario
tests, those lines added up.  Thinking about it a bit, I realized that I was not going
to change this format because it was consistently worked well for me.  Declared before
this code block
in each test, the variables <code>source_markdown</code>, <code>expected_tokens</code> and <code>expected_gfm</code> held
the relative information for each test.  Once set, I could not think of any reason to
alter from the pattern of calling the three validation functions, one after another.</p>
<p>At the same time, if I was going to make this change on a large scale, I wanted to start
out with a smaller scope of work and validate it first.  At that point, I created a new
<code>act_and_assert</code> function to contain those seven lines of code, and changed that code
block from above to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="c1"># Act &amp; Assert</span>
    <span class="n">act_and_assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source_markdown</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expected_gfm</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expected_tokens</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After testing it out on a couple of scenario tests, I applied it to all the scenario
tests in the <code>test_markdown_paragraph_series_n.py</code> module and the
<code>test_markdown_block_quotes.py</code> module.  Making sure the scenario tests all worked,
including introducing some false failures that I immediately fixed, I decided to leave
it alone for a while.  My thought process was that I would let it “set” in my mind.
If I was still interested in making the change after a week or so, I could
work on it over the course of a couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="link-reference-definitions-and-containers">Link Reference Definitions and Containers<a class="headerlink" href="#link-reference-definitions-and-containers" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the issues list, the following item gained my attention:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">split</span> <span class="n">up</span> <span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">definition</span> <span class="n">within</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">block</span> <span class="n">quote</span> <span class="k">or</span> <span class="n">list</span><span class="o">?</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While I was not sure it was going to be easy, I at least figured that it would be fun!
At the base level, it was an interesting question.  Block Quote elements and List Block
elements altered the way a line was processed, and Link Reference Definitions could span
lines and not appear to follow the right rules.  To that end, I added three new
scenario tests <code>test_block_quotes_extra_03x</code> to <code>test_block_quotes_extra_03b</code> and I
added three new scenario tests <code>test_list_items_extra_01x</code> to <code>test_list_items_extra_01b</code>.</p>
<p>The bad news first.  Try as I may, I was not able to get the new Block Quote tests to
pass within a decent amount of time.  As such, I had to commit them as disabled tests.</p>
<p>The ContainerBlockProcessor was largely unchanged, with the changes in that class being
made to get rid of code or simplify code, rather than fix issues.  The Markdown transformer
was altered to produce the proper output if there were any leading spaces in the list that
were not being merged in by the Link Reference Definition token.  Those were the easier
two fixes.  The hard changes involved the HTML transformer.</p>
<h3 id="list-looseness-again">List Looseness… Again<a class="headerlink" href="#list-looseness-again" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While I thought all my issues regarding list looseness were behind me, I was wrong.
Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list is loose if any of its constituent list items are separated by blank lines, or if any of its constituent list items directly contain two block-level elements with a blank line between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking that down, a list is lose if, for any item within the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is not the first item and preceded by a blank line</li>
<li>it is not the last item and followed by a blank line</li>
<li>any item contains any two block elements that are separated by a blank line</li>
</ul>
<p>How is this related to Link Reference Definitions?  When the PyMarkdown processors
parse a Link Reference Definition element, it creates a token that represents that
element so it can be analyzed.  However, from an HTML point of view, it does not exist.
As such, the following Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="err">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>is for HTML output purposes equal to the Markdown:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, from the HTML transformer point of view, it is a Blank Line element. I had some
code in the <code>__is_token_loose</code> function to report a Link Reference Definition as a Blank
Line element and in the <code>__calculate_list_looseness</code> to trigger off a block, but it
was not that simple.  Rereading the above section on looseness, it only really mattered
inside of the list item if that Blank Line element was between two blocks.</p>
<p>Fixing that specific case took a bit of work in the <code>__calculate_list_looseness</code> function
to redesign the way I was handling those cases.  In cases where the previous token was
a Blank Line, I had to change the algorithm to look before that element and see if there
was a valid block token there.  It so, the logic from the last point above would come
into play,
and it would discover a valid case to check.  Otherwise, the Blank Line token or the
Link Reference Definition token would be intentionally overlooked, and the search would
continue.</p>
<h3 id="repeat-with-block-quotes">Repeat, With Block Quotes<a class="headerlink" href="#repeat-with-block-quotes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>It was no surprise that I had to do similar work with Block Quote elements to make sure
that they were also working properly.  To accommodate that, I added five new scenarios
and did a lot of debugging.  In the end, the fix was to add a flag in the
<code>__handle_blank_line</code> function that triggered when a Link Referenced Definition had
been started.  Rather than avoid the default handling in this case, that handle was
carried out and appended to the already created tokens, resulting the proper output.</p>
<p>Once that fix was made, getting the consistency checks to agree with it was
easy, with one calculation for the <code>leading_text_index</code> being off by 1.  After a
simple adjustment to compensate for that case, those tests were now passing.
After only an hour and a half of work to get this working, I understood that I was
lucky that it did not end up taking as long as the last set of issues to fix.  I
was grateful!</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-how-i-was-spending-my-holiday">Evaluating How I Was Spending My Holiday<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluating-how-i-was-spending-my-holiday" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I do not think that I am a workaholic, I just like to keep busy.  Whether it is figuring
out how to do something with home automation, working on a puzzle, cleaning up the
garage (again!?), or working on this project, it does not matter.  If it is
something that keeps me from spending hours doing one thing with no recognizable thing
to show for it, I am good.  Spending time with my wife helping her out with shopping
works wonderfully for that.  I get to spend time doing crossword puzzles and other fun
things on my phone while waiting for her to finish at various stores she needs to go
to.  For me, it is all about perspective.</p>
<p>So, it was part of the way through Christmas Eve Day when I thought about this with
respect to the project.  While it was true that I was resolving items from the issues
list, it just was not feeling like it was the right thing to do at that time.  As I had
the weeks before and after Christmas off, I sat back and decided that I wanted
to do something for the project that would be hard to do at any other time.  I mean,
since I have the time, was I using it to my best advantage?</p>
<p>Within minutes, I had an answer of “No, I was not using my time wisely!”.  I had a
couple of long-term things I wanted to
do with the code base, but those things would be hard to fit into a normal week’s worth
of work.  It was time to shift gears.</p>
<h3 id="reducing-the-code-required-to-check-for-a-specific-token">Reducing the Code Required To Check For A Specific Token<a class="headerlink" href="#reducing-the-code-required-to-check-for-a-specific-token" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While this was done very leisurly over two days, this change was something I had wanted to
do for a while.  As the project’s growth was organic, I had started out check for the
pressence of a given token by looking at its name.  At that time, given the rule module
<code>rule_md_019.py</code>, if I wanted to see if a given token was a paragraph, I would use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type_name</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">token_paragraph</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that comparison, but it did have things going
against it.  The first was that I had to make sure to import the MarkdownToken class into
any module where I wanted such a comparison.  Next was my observation that I usually had
to go to the <code>markdown_token.py</code> module and find out exactly how the token’s type name
was spelled, hopefully avoiding any naming errors.  Finally, I found it bulky.  I guess
if I had to add more description to bulky, it was that it took an awful lot of typing to
figure out that the token was a paragraph.  And if it took a lot of typing, it would also
take a lot of reading to do the same thing.  I needed something simpler.</p>
<p>Working through a couple of possibilities, I decided to use a simple approach and replace
that entire line with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_paragraph</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It required no extra imports, the naming was easy to remember, and it was as simple as I
could make it without short forms that would make it to read.  Sure <code>is_para</code> might be more
compact, but what was I really going to save with that?</p>
<p>Over the course of approximately ten commits, I transferred all the Markdown Tokens from the
old way of comparing token types to the new way.  I started with Paragraphs and the other
Leaf Block tokens, moving on to Container Block tokens, before finishing up with
Inline tokens.  By the time I was done, there were more lines and functions present in
the base MarkdownToken class, but the entire code base seemed to read better.</p>
<p>And that was the point of these changes.  No scenario tests were changed as a part of
this code base change, I just wanted it to read better!</p>
<h3 id="do-i-make-the-code-more-object-oriented">Do I Make The Code More Object Oriented?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-make-the-code-more-object-oriented" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having made those changes, I felt emboldened to make another set of changes that I had
been itching to do for a while: making the code more object oriented.</p>
<p>While each programming paradigm has its good points and bad points, object-oriented was
something I have had a lot of experience with.  At its core
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a>
had three pivotal concepts: encapsulation, composition, and polymorphism.  As the
PyMarkdown project generates tokens after parsing the Markdown document, I was most
interested in encapsulation and polymorphism and how they could be applied to tokens.</p>
<p>From an encapsulation point of view, with a couple of exceptions<sup id="fnref:tokens"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tokens">1</a></sup> there is no
reason to want to change the values of any of those parsed tokens.  In the case of those
exceptional tokens, there is a
multiline concept present in that token that needs to be properly tracked by any
after-parsing process.  Other than providing that tracking information during a specific
after-parsing process, those fields do not have any meaning to a consumer.  Therefore,
it is okay that they are exposed.  However, I did not feel that it was the case with
the other values.</p>
<p>And from a polymorphism point of view, it makes sense to me that the tokens should be
organized
into groups of tokens that have similar properties: Container Blocks, Leaf Blocks, and
Inlines. As such, it also follows that some properties and methods are present in one or
more of those groups of tokens, but not all those groups.  So having a base class for each
of those groups is something to work towards.</p>
<p>For both reasons, it just made sense to me to proceed!</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-endmarkdowntoken">Starting with EndMarkdownToken<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-endmarkdowntoken" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the decision made to move forward with this transition, I started at the base by
making those changes with the <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> class.  To be honest, as I worked
through the project’s development, I always felt a bit guilty that I had let the use
of this token get out of control.</p>
<p>From my observations, this class is a “hidden” fourth class of tokens, providing a
close token to any of the tokens that provide for start functionality.  As this
functionality ranges across all three groups of tokens, the <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> exists off
to the side in its own space.  Because of this special grouping, it was the ideal token
to start with.</p>
<p>To change this token, I started off with the <code>EndMarkdownToken.type_name_prefix</code> field
which contains the string that gets prepended to the start of any <code>EndMarkdownToken</code>
type name.  Moving it into the <code>MarkdownToken</code> class made the use of that field
self-contained, allowing it be modified into a protected field.<sup id="fnref:protected"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:protected">2</a></sup>  To accomplish
that change, I created a new <code>generate_close_markdown_token_from_markdown_token</code> function
that allowed me to generate the proper <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> from a given Markdown token.</p>
<p>To me, this just made sense.  By performing these changes, I had an easy way of
generating
an <code>EndMarkdownToken</code> that was documented and set all the right fields.  I was able to
make sure that the <code>start_markdown_token</code> field was set.  As it had not been
set consistently, there were places in the code base where I had to do work arounds to
try
and figure out where the start token for a given end token was.  This was just cleaner.</p>
<h3 id="simple-refactorings">Simple Refactorings<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-refactorings" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Two of the paradigms that have served me well in my years of software development are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">D.R.Y.</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">S.O.L.I.D</a>. The ‘L” in S.O.L.I.D. stands for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a>,
which (in its abbreviated form) states that an object should be able to be replaced
with another object that adheres to the same contract without any parent objects being
aware of the change.</p>
<p>With respect to the PyMarkdown project, I had been using the <code>isinstance</code> built-in
to deal with things instead of following the principle.  However, with the recent
round of refactorings completed, I was able to fix that.  While it may not seem like
much, it made me feel better to change:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">AtxHeadingMarkdownToken</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>into a more SOLID-like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_atx_heading</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While I know that there is only one implementation of the <code>AtxHeadingMarkdownToken</code>
class, I was just not comfortable with having calls of <code>isinstance</code> scattered throughout
the code base.  Over two commits, I was able to eliminate all uses of <code>isinstance</code> except
for six legitimate uses of it in pivotal parts of the code base.</p>
<p>As with the other changes, this change was a simple change, but an effective one.  With all
the checks for various tokens using a single manner of access, it was now easier to scan
the code base for locations where a given token was referenced.  That, and to me, it just
looked neater.</p>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-the-leaf-block-tokens-and-endmarkdowntoken">Cleaning Up The Leaf Block Tokens and EndMarkdownToken<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-up-the-leaf-block-tokens-and-endmarkdowntoken" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>All those changes inspired me, and I gave myself the green light to further encapsulate the
private fields as Python private fields.  It was not even remotely exciting, but it was
something I knew would make the code cleaner and more maintainable.  Using this
stripped-down example of the <code>EndMarkdownToken</code>, this is where all the tokens started:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EndMarkdownToken</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">type_name</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">type_name</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For each of the Leaf Block tokens, I then started by adding the two underscores to the
start of the field name, per Python requirements.  But as that made the field “invisible”
to other objects, I then needed to add a new function with the <code>property</code> decorator to
be able to retrieve the value.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EndMarkdownToken</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MarkdownToken</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">type_name</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__type_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">type_name</span>

    <span class="nd">@property</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">type_name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__type_name</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat.  Nothing special or exciting, which was what I was going for.  There
were no weird cases with these tokens that required a special setter function, so no
workarounds were needed.  And because the previously public field name and the newly added
property name had the exact same name, so changes were needed in other parts of the code.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I really cannot lie on this one.  While it was good to resolve some items off the
issues list, it was really good to get these refactorings done.  I have had those
ideas on how to clean up the project in my mind for weeks, and just getting them
done gave me a bit of an extra pep in my step.  It is not that they were any more
or less important than the other items, it is just that their large scope meant it
was going to be hard to fit them in.  As such, they always went into the “if I
ever have some time” bucket… and never seen again.</p>
<p>I honestly think that taking the time to focus on what was important to me with
this project was good for me and the project.  It helped me refocus on the things
that I find important.  It helped the project by being able to present a more
concise and readable code base to any interested parties.  In all, it was a win-win.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With a week left of holidays, I had hoped to get a similar mix of items dealt with
