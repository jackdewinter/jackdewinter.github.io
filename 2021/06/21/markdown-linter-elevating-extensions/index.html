<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/06/14/markdown-linter-getting-stuff-done/">last article</a>, I talked
about getting back to PyMarkdown and my efforts to remove items from the issues list.
In this article, I talk about elevating the extension object support in the PyMarkdown
project to the same level as plugins rules.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is not going to be a terribly long article.  Not for lack of content, but for
lack of cleanly reportable content.  For me, cleanly reportable contents are things
that I can say “here is what I did” or “I did this because”.  And for this week’s
work, that content is mostly about documentation and reorganization.</p>
<p>It was in the weeks leading up to this work that I started thinking about extensions
in a different light.  That light was that extensions and plugin rules were similar
concepts, but for different foundation objects.  As soon as that idea settled into
my brain, I knew I needed to elevate extensions to the same level as plugins.</p>
<p>But here is the hard part for a writer.  Writing about documentation is boring.
Writing about refactoring is boring.  “Hey, I refactored this function from
this module to this other module and made it work” is not exactly something
that screams “read me!”  Neither is talking about how I spent hours agonizing
over trying to get the right theme and voice for the documentation.  I mean,
readers that are writers may sympathize, but I am very sure that is all.
And while I do talk about why I made certain moves
or enhancements, there is only so much of that content available.</p>
<p>Here is to hoping that I can make refactoring and documentation more interesting!</p>

<h2 id="making-extensions-first-class-citizens">Making Extensions First-Class Citizens<a class="headerlink" href="#making-extensions-first-class-citizens" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>It was a while ago when I started asking myself if extensions needed to be on the same level
as plugin rules.  In any kind of rules engine, such as a linter, the object holding the
rules is a first-class citizen by default.  Basically, you need the engine, and you need
the rule.  Without either one, the other one is useless.  As the rules are contained
within plugin objects, those plugin rules are first-class citizens.  As one of my
professors in college would say “Q.E.D.”</p>
<p>But what about extensions?  Was there a similar argument to be made for extensions
being first-class citizens?  For the last few months, I was convinced that similar arguments
could not be made for the extensions.  After all, what did extensions do for the rules
engine?  How did they enhance the behavior of the linter?  At best, they were scan-time
switches that had a bit of an algorithm behind them.</p>
<p>And then one evening, after one of the most embarrassing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facepalm">face palms</a>
in my professional life, I realized that I was getting that answer because I had
been asking the wrong question.
I had been looking for a similar argument, starting at the same starting point as with
plugin rules: the linter.  What I needed to ask myself is whether there are any other major
components that I could use as a foundation element.  I needed think about whether
one of the other components had a similar relationship with extensions that the plugin
rules have with the linter.  At that point, it was obvious to me
that there was a good solid answer: the PyMarkdown parser.</p>
<p>While I do not need the same flexibility with the extensions that I do with
the plugin rules, I do need some of the same options.  The big options I currently
need for the extensions are configurability and observability.  Extensions require
configuration to allow them to be enabled or disabled, and not much more. As such,
the configuration aspect was already dealt with, but could be made more transparent
to the user.</p>
<p>The first half of the observability option was already taken care of: the token
stream.  If enabled and if their conditions are met, both the Pragma extension and
the Front-Matter extension place a token in the token stream generated by the parser.
But the other half was important as well, and that was observability from
the command line.  The Plugin Manager presents that information to the command
line through the <code>list</code> and <code>info</code> subcommands.  And from my use of the command
line to check to see if a plugin rule is enabled, it worked well.</p>
<p>But was it really a good model?  Would it work for users other than myself?
It was an interesting idea, but I needed to give it more time to develop.
Luckily enough, I needed to work on documentation first.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-is-important">Documentation Is Important<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation-is-important" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>I felt that it was the right decision to increase the project’s support for
extensions to the same level as with the rule plugins.  I also knew that the
first step on that path was to create a landing page
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/extensions.md">for extensions</a>,
linking the existing two placeholder pages for each extension to that page.  With
that accomplished, the task to fill out those two placeholder pages was next on the
list.</p>
<p>To show how seriously I took this effort, I did not want to commit something in that was
half done.  So, even with about 90% of the work done by the time I started writing last
week’s article, I elected to not commit that work that I had completed.  It just did not
feel right, so it was not until I spent some time on Wednesday and Thursday to complete
those two documents that I committed those changes.  And I was glad that I made that
decision.</p>
<p>If any reader is under the delusion that documentation is easy, let me address that
notion.  To be blunt, adding documentation is easy.  Sit down, write some stuff,
and save it into a file.  Done.  But that will not produce good quality documentation
that is well thought out, easy to read, and addresses the concepts that readers
expect.  I am not sure about other writers, but for me that usually involves at least
5 passes through the document, from a rough note pass in the beginning to a
grammar/spelling/fine-tuning pass at the end.  The adage is true: Garbage in,
garbage out.</p>
<p>So, I take my documentation tasks seriously. If I want the project to have a high
level of quality, every part needs to have a high level of quality, including
documentation.  For me, creating a project is about the completed picture that
is presented by the project, not just the source code.  So, without reservations,
I worked on the documentation, giving it the time that it needed and not
compromising.</p>
<h3 id="improving-through-documentation">Improving Through Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-through-documentation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>As I have talked about before, walking through documentation is also a great way to see
if you have properly implemented and tested a feature.  This was no exception.
Between both extensions, I added 10 new scenario tests to make sure the extensions
were tested properly.  There were not any really serious omissions in the tests,
just “interesting” corner cases that might come up in everyday usage.  It was not
until I was walking through the documentation, writing the words, that I thought
“well, what if I…”.</p>
<p>Along the way, to make things easier, I introduced the <code>ParseBlockPassProperties</code>
to contain any parsing related properties that I needed to pass around.  While I
only had two extensions at this point, I knew that other ones were coming.  My
intention is to use this class as a simple data class, allowing me to pass around
properties that are moderately static.  At this point, I use the term “moderately
static” to refer to instances that are not going to change during the parsing of
the document.  As the flags to see if the extensions are enabled so not change
during the parsing, this is a single place to put them that can easily be passed
into functions.</p>
<h2 id="adding-the-extension-manager">Adding The Extension Manager<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-the-extension-manager" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next part on the journey to make extension first-class citizens was to create
an Extension Manager.  My vision of the Plugin Manager was that it was the object
completely responsible for anything to do with plugin rules. If that was so, then
it made sense that I would create an Extension Manager to serve as the same type of
foundational object, an object responsible for anything to do with the extensions.</p>
<p>That idea also made sense to me from a more practical point of view.  By going along the path
that extensions and the Extension Manager were in the same mold as plugins and
the Plugin Manager, it meant that there were common code and concepts that I
could use from the Plugin Manager, saving some time.  From my viewpoint, if
I honestly agreed that there was overlap, and did not force myself to believe
there was overlap, I could probably repurpose any code that implemented overlapping
functionality.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I created a copy of Plugin Manager and started pulling anything
that was plugin specific out of the new Extension Manager.  Instead of scanning
a directory and loading any found plugins, I decided that extension would only
be added from a list maintained by the class.  While this resulted in the removal
of the scanning and loading code, it was done for a more practical reason. Unlike
the plugin rules, currently each extension requires a hard-coded entry point
from the parser.  I hope to change that in the future, but that is where it is
currently.</p>
<p>What was left?  The <code>apply_configuration</code> function was slightly changed to handle
the extensions, but the same idea of an “enabled extensions” list was maintained.
That made it easy to keep the command line logic for listing the extensions, with
only slight modifications.  Similarly, the logic for displaying the information
on a specific extension on required slight changes, mostly in the formatting of
the data to be displayed.</p>
<p>The determination of the enabled state of the extensions was also kept mostly
intact, but with two key changes.  Whereas plugins have multiple identifiers,
the plugin id and one or more plugin names, extensions only have one identifier.
That simplified some code from six lines down to one line.  At least for now,
another change is that I commented out the code to allow the extensions to be
directly enabled and disabled from the command line.  To be honest, I am not
sure if I feel the need to enabled extensions with the same flexibility and
frequency as with plugins.  I will think about that and get back to that later.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up<a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-it-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>All in all, it took about a good solid six to eight hours to get everything
coded and the tests all passing.  To round everything out, I decided to include
a debug extension (<code>extension_one.py</code>) and a roughed-out module for each
extension listed in the GitHub Flavored Markdown specification.  The debug
extension was just a tricky, hidden way in which I could test some of the
more difficult to reach places in the Extension Manager.</p>
<p>As to the placeholder extensions, I just felt that it was a good time to
get those features, or something standing in for those features, in the
project.  I did not have any plans of adding them anytime soon, but I did
want to show that I had plans to add them.  I also did some mental exercises
and walked through how I might implement each one of them.  I did not do this
out of a need to design those extensions, but to ensure that the work I
was doing on the Extension Manager could support those hypothetical designs.</p>
<p>There really was not much to test, because this was largely a reorganization
of features. As such, there were only a couple of small changes to the
copies of the tests from the Plugin Manager, and a couple of extra tests to
fill in some code coverage blind sports.</p>
<p>With that hard work done, it was on to the next thing!</p>
<h2 id="welcoming-code-into-the-fold">Welcoming Code Into The Fold<a class="headerlink" href="#welcoming-code-into-the-fold" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Next up was a simple set of refactorings to try and come up with
a set of behaviors that would help constrain the extensions so that
they could be treated as a class of objects instead of a collection
of distinct objects.</p>
<p>To start, I looked at the <code>PluginDetails</code> object from the Plugin
Manager and created an <code>ExtensionDetails</code> class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_id</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_name</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_description</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_enabled_by_default</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_version</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_interface_version</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_url</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">extension_configuration</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Other than replacing the text <code>plugin</code> with <code>extension</code> and replacing
<code>plugin_names</code> with <code>extension_name</code>, no changes were needed.  In addition,
instead of using the pattern of having a <code>FoundPlugin</code> class as the
intermediary for this information, I decided to implement two separate
member variables, one for each concern. The <code>self.__extension_objects</code>
variable contains a dictionary of the extension classes, while the
<code>self.__extension_details</code> variable contains a dictionary of their
<code>ExtensionDetails</code> classes.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not sure which approach is cleaner.  Having a class that
is the same as another class with one extra field or having two lists.
At the very least, I think I want to come to a resolution on these
approaches and unify them going forward.  But to do that, I need to
see how both perform and decide.</p>
<h3 id="and-to-finish-up">And To Finish Up<a class="headerlink" href="#and-to-finish-up" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given all that work to get everything extension related into the
new Extension Manager class, there was one small bit of work left
to do.  None of it was terribly difficult, but for the sake of
neatness, I believe it was all required.</p>
<p>First, I took the existing content of the <code>__init__</code> function of
the <code>ParseBlockPassProperties</code> class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">properties</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">properties</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__front_matter_enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_boolean_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"extensions.front-matter.enabled"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__pragmas_enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_boolean_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"extensions.pragmas.enabled"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and replaced it with a more Extension Manager friendly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">extension_manager</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__front_matter_enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">extension_manager</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_front_matter_enabled</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__pragmas_enabled</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">extension_manager</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_linter_pragmas_enabled</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pragma_lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once again, nothing difficult, but it was important to me to get this main
switch for the two existing extensions moved over.</p>
<p>After that, I moved the <code>compile_pragmas</code> function from the Plugin Manager
and the <code>look_for_pragmas</code> function from the Container Block Processor
over to the <code>PragmaExtension</code> class.  In the process of moving that code
over, I changed the identifer for the extension from <code>pragma</code> to
<code>linter-pragmas</code>.</p>
<h3 id="why-was-this-important">Why Was This Important?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-was-this-important" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is a saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
More often, this is used to indicate that if things do not require any
effort to let them keep on going forward, do not disturb them. But that
saying really relies on one important decision point: is the thing in
question broken?</p>
<p>At some point soon, I do want to implement the other
extensions outlined in the GFM Specification.  While some of them
do not have a lot of benefit in my mind (strikethrough), there are others
that I do assign a large benefit to (tables).  It makes sense to
do some of that leg work now, knowing that I will use it later.</p>
<p>In my mind, there is another, more important factor to consider.
That factor concerns the cost to implement some of the features
in the Plugin Manager without going all in.  One of the reasons
that I created the Extension Manager in the way I did was the
low cost associated with copying it from the Plugin Manager.
I was able to reuse most of the application code and the scenario
test code in the process.  Sure, I had to change it to work with
extensions instead of plugins, but I saved a lot of time and
effort by taking that approach.</p>
<p>If I did not take that approach, I would have had to develop
another type of manager with its own quirks.  That means starting
out with a new set of requirements and tests that I needed to
satisfy.  That would take time and effort.  And in the end,
unless plugin rules and extensions do not have the overlap that
I believe they do, I would probably want to collapse them into
one paradigm anyways.</p>
<p>I was confident that the overlap was sufficient to
make copying the Plugin Manager code a smart move.  Now it is
just a matter of time to prove to myself that it was the right
choice.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A friend of mine who is a writer has often reminded me that it is those
things that we find more difficult to do are the most rewarding.  I
am seriously not a writer; through I do try and write to the best of
my ability.  While I am on the road to being a “capital-W” writer at
some point, should I choose to do so, I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>But I do find it rewarding.  Yes, I even find writing documentation
rewarding.  I find writing these weekly articles rewarding.
Part of that is because I find satisfaction in helping people. What
else is documentation than helping people understand or use a
particular object or project?</p>
<p>And that is the key for me: it helps people… including myself.
This process of adding an Extension Manager during this beta release
period was not a decision that I made lightly.  It could have
gone horribly wrong.  But it did not because I had a number of support
structures in place, including documentation on the extensions.
It was in walking through them that I figured out I needed to elevate
extensions, and it was walking through them again that I helped
myself have a coherent implementation about extensions.</p>
<p>So now I have an Extension Manager that cleanly takes care of the
extensions.  It exposes a common command line interface with the
Plugin Manager, so there is synergy there.  It is not as full featured
as the Plugin Manager, but it does not need to be.  And I am
happy with where it landed!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With that refactoring out of the way, I thought I would have some “fun”
in the next week and try to solve an issue I have had for a while:
making sure that the parser can handle transitions back and forth between
lists and block quotes.</p>
