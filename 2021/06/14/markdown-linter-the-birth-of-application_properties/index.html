<h2 id="cleanup">Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#cleanup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As always, I try and make the projects that I work on better, and this week
was no different.  During the testing that I did in the above section, I noticed
that I was getting an error at the end of the test runs.  For the ~15% of the time
that the occurred, it indicated that the coverage file was not valid.  It was
easy enough to fix; I just re-ran the tests.  But that got annoying quickly.</p>
<p>Looking online, the quickest solution seemed to be to go back to the <code>pytest-cov</code>
package’s <code>2.10.1</code> version and the <code>coverage</code> package’s <code>4.5.4</code> version.  It
seems a bit slower now, but that error does not show up any more.  When I have
some time, I will look at it some more, but for now, it was fixed.</p>
<p>Other than that, the only change that bears mentioning is that I cleaned up
the file <code>unordered_list_into_atx_into_paragraph.md</code> to make it simpler to
parse instead of containing a long list and a long paragraph. I am not sure
if that added the violation of rule <code>md022</code> or not, but I added it to the test
that references that file to make sure it was reporting cleanly.</p>
<p>Once again, nothing serious, just some simple cleanup.</p>
<h2 id="issue-8-exposing-command-line-options-as-configuration-items">Issue 8: Exposing Command Line Options As Configuration Items<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-8-exposing-command-line-options-as-configuration-items" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/8">Issue 8</a> was created
to address a simple issue: the <code>--stack-trace</code> and <code>--add-plugin</code> command
line arguments did not have an corresponding equivalent in the configuration
system.  While it may seem like a trivial change, for me it was an
important one.  It was very important to me that unless there was a very
good reason on a case-by-case basis, each command line item should have
a command line item.  Except for these two command line flags, every
other reasonable case had been addressed.</p>
<p>It was time to fix this.</p>
<h3 id="code-changes">Code Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#code-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The change for the <code>--stack-trace</code> flag was a simple change at the
start of the <code>__initialize_logging</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__show_stack_trace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">show_stack_trace</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__show_stack_trace</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__show_stack_trace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_boolean_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="s2">"log.stack-trace"</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The logic was changed to follow the same configuration ordering as is
detailed in the
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/advanced_configuration.md#configuration-property-ordering">Advanced Configuration</a>
document.  Prior to this change, only the command line flag was being checked.
With this change, if the command line flag was not used, then the configuration
system is queried to determine if the stack trace should be enabled.</p>
<p>While a slight bit more complex, similar changes were required for
the <code>xxx</code> function in the plugin manager.  Originally, the code was
very simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">additional_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">next_additional_plugin</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">additional_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, if the command line provided any addition plugin paths to
explore, they were placed in the <code>additional_paths</code> variable that
contained an array of paths.  The <code>for</code> statement at the end of
the example leads into the code that handles loading plugins when
either a directory or a file is specified.  Very simple, and very
straightforward.</p>
<p>This is where the code got more complex, but not unbearably so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">all_additional_paths</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">additional_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">all_additional_paths</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">additional_paths</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">more_paths</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_string_property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"plugins.additional_paths"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">more_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">all_additional_paths</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">more_paths</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">","</span><span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">all_additional_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">next_additional_plugin</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">all_additional_paths</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In the new code, the variable <code>all_additional_paths</code> is the new array
that contains all the paths.  First, that array is primed with
anything presented on the command line, as before.  Then the configuration
system is checked to see if any additional paths are specified.  If
any string is specified, it is treated as a comma-separated list and
processed into elements as such.  That list of paths is then added
to the end of the <code>all_additional_paths</code> list, and then processing
resumes as before.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-changes">Documentation Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The code changes to get this working took approximately 40 minutes to
complete, from writing the first scenario test to ensuring that each
tests was passing properly.  The interesting part was in documenting
the behaviors of these flags.  Specifically, the issue was in
documenting the <code>--stack-trace</code> flag versus the <code>log.stack-trace</code>
configuration item.</p>
<p>In both cases, the actual documentation for command line option versus
configuration item took minimal effort.  However, in the case of the
<code>--stack-trace</code> flag, there is a significant difference that needed
to be documented.</p>
<p>Prior to this change, the documentation for the flag was limited to
this entry in the <a href="adv-conf">adv conf</a> file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if an error occurs, print out the stack trace for debug purposes.  Also
sets the initial logging (config processing) to debug. (Default: <code>false</code>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While that was true while just the command line flag was present, it
also didn’t go into much depth on what the other effects are. As I wanted
to make sure I was being clear, I took my time to properly document
the differences between the command line flag and the configuration item.</p>
<p>It was a simple difference, but it took some explaining.  Once the
logging system was initialized, the behavior of both items was exactly
the same.  The difference was in the behavior before the logging
system was initialized.  I needed to ensure that if there was an
error logged before the logging system was initialized, that I can
diagnose it.  Therefore, the command line flag ensures that [more].</p>
<h2 id="issue-9-better-plugins-support">Issue 9: Better Plugins Support<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-9-better-plugins-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>One thing that had been bothering me for a while were the few items from
the Issues List that made up <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/9">Issue 9</a>.
I had thought out the rules plugins far in advance of when I needed them,
but I hadn’t applied that same rigor to exposing those plugins to the command line.
I felt that I had done okay in exposing the plugins to the command line,
but I felt I could do better.</p>
<h3 id="plugin-lists">Plugin Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#plugin-lists" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first thing on that list of “to do better” was the listing of the
available plugins via <code>plugins list</code>.  After using that command a few times to check on the
plugins, I was convinced that two two enabled columns, <code>enabled (default)</code>
and <code>enabled (current)</code>, did not have to take up the space that they did.
After performing some experiments, I found that by specifying each column
title with a newline character in the middle that the column headings would
split over multiple lines.  Changing the two columns titles to <code>enabled\n(default)</code>
and <code>enabled\n(current)</code> provided the exact effect that I was looking for.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  ID     NAMES                                 ENABLED    ENABLED    VERSION
                                               (DEFAULT)  (CURRENT)

  md001  heading-increment, header-increment   True       True       0.5.0
  md002  first-heading-h1, first-header-h1     False      False      0.5.0
  md003  heading-style, header-style           True       True       0.5.0
  md018  no-missing-space-atx                  True       True       0.5.0
  md019  no-multiple-space-atx                 True       True       0.5.0
</pre></div>
<p>While I was doing my experiments, I also found that I was not handling the
case of no matching plugins was not handled properly.  To be honest, it
just was not being handled at all.  To take care of that, I simply added
a check against <code>if show_rows</code> in the <code>__handle_argparse_subparser_list</code>
function, printing out a nicely formatted message if that case was encountered.</p>
<h3 id="plugins-info">Plugins Info<a class="headerlink" href="#plugins-info" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second thing on my list was to elevate the <code>plugins info</code> response to
something that I would be proud to look at.  The effort that I had put
in before was easily a place holder, one that now needed to be replaced.
I had two goals for this change: make it look better and display
relevant information to the command line user.</p>
<p>The first part of that was easy.  Leveraging my work in the previous
section to display thing in columns, I decided that the information
would be best presented in a simple two column format.  From my point
of view, that would nicely take care of cleaning up the display, producing
output similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  ITEM                 DESCRIPTION

  Id                   md001
  Name(s)              heading-increment,header-increment
  Short Description    Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time.
</pre></div>
<p>Sitting back for a bit and looking at that design, I went
through the mental excercise of trying to figure out why a user would
want to look at that information.  The two most likely candidates that
I came with were seeing the rule they were looking at mentioned in
an output violation line or in a configuration file.</p>
<p>For the configuration file case, I figured that a user would want to know
if the configuration item they see in the configuration file matches a
valid configuration item for the rule plugin.  For the output violation
case, I figured that a user would want to see information about why that
violation was raised.</p>
<p>Not wanting to overload the command line, I decided on an approach that
would address both issues.  Without overloading the user, I decided that
there was no really good way of displaying the rule information that was
included in the rule’s documentation url.  However, displaying that url
so that they could look for more information there made sense to me.
In addition, the configuration item case could be somewhat handled in
a similar way.  If I presented a line detailing what the configuration
items were, any further information on those items could also be handled
by the url.</p>
<p>Combining both designs together, I came up with the following sample
of what I wanted the output for Rule md001 to look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  ITEM                 DESCRIPTION

  Id                   md001
  Name(s)              heading-increment,header-increment
  Short Description    Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time.
  Description Url      https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/blob/main/docs/rules/rule_md001.md
  Configuration Items  front_matter_title
</pre></div>
<p>After modifying a scenario test for md001 and adding scenario tests for
md023 and the debug rule md999, it was time to write the code.</p>
<h3 id="making-it-work">Making It Work<a class="headerlink" href="#making-it-work" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once I had the sample output defined in the last section, the rest was
easy.  I went back to the <code>plugin_manager.py</code> module and the modules for
each plugin rule and added two optional properties: <code>plugin_url</code> and
<code>plugin_configuration</code>.  If the plugin rules provided the properties,
they would be displayed in the <code>plugins info</code> output, otherwise they
would be silently omitted.</p>
<p>With those two new properties added to the various plugin classes,
I then started to work on the <code>__handle_argparse_subparser_info</code>
function to make it output the information in columns.  As the
<code>columnar</code> packages took care of the formatting, I just needed to organize
the data into a series of rows, each row containing a title column
and a description column.  That was quickly accomplished within
fifteen minutes of work.</p>
<p>Other than some slight issues with adjusting column widths in the test
output, everything worked right away.  The column adjustments that
needed to be made were completed within five minutes, and everything
was buttoned down after ten minutes.</p>
<p>While I am not sure it is perfect yet, the output is now definitely
something that I can be proud of!</p>

<p>Getting to wrap things up on Saturday, I decided to look on the list and
find an easy item to resolve.  Lucky for me I found the issue detailed in
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/10">Issue 10</a>.
While easily not large, it was easily something that I want to start doing more of
in the future.</p>
<p>During the development prior to the beta release, I spend a lot of time getting
things working properly.  That meant passing the GFM specification example tests
as well as my own tests, the ones verified against BabelMark.  While I tried
to make the best decisions each time, I admit freely that in some cases I added
code in a place that was less than optimal, knowing I would probably revisit
it later.</p>
<p>The development of rule <code>md022</code> was one of those cases.  To properly track the
number of blank lines before and after a Heading element, the rule needed to
be coded to understand if an end token was a container token, a leaf token,
or (by default) an inline token.  To that extent, I added the
<code>__is_container_end_token</code> function and the <code>__is_leaf_end_token</code> function to
the <code>rule_md_022.py</code> module to accomplish that goal.  Knowing that it may
not be the best place for those functions, I added an item to the Issues
List for later examination.</p>
<p>Was that the right thing to do?  Yes… and no.  I added those functions
to the <code>rule_md_022.py</code> module to get things working, as I was focusing on
verifying those rules.  I cannot remember exactly what was going through
my head at the time, but knowing that I needed to take a better look at
it when I had the bandwidth, I made a note in the Issues List in
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/445c7a15bd926112146167eb1ac0d3f90c4f5de5#diff-75b56c206e0ed5079aed5347ecab9d243732195ecf4ed3cd478610fe86b105ec">the same commit</a>
as that change.  I simply noted that I wanted to double check it later,
and went back to focusing on the code that I was working on.</p>
<p>If you ask me for my opinion on whether it was the right thing to do,
without more questions I could not properly answer either yes or no.
It depends.  However, one thing I am certain about.  Not fixing it right
away and not noting it down for later would be the wrong thing to do.
And to be honest, I am okay with knowing that I avoided doing the wrong
thing, and not sure if I did the right thing.</p>

<p>While it might seem weird to some people, it was a fun and relaxing week
week, it was a nice and relaxing small break.  I felt refreshed.</p>

<p>Getting back to PyMarkdown, I start to go through the issues list, with the goal</p>
