<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/03/15/markdown-linter-road-to-initial-release-front-matter/">last article</a>, I talked about
my own requirements for a front-matter processor and how I added it to the project.  In
this article, I talk about my own requirements for configuration and how I applied them
to this project.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes I encounter a part of a programming language that I do not like for one
reason or another.  For whatever reason, the concept of having a good entry-level
configuration library for each given language seems to be not high on anyone’s
priority list. To be clear, I know that there are libraries out there for each language
that do some form of property reading and access, but the support is always basic
at best. If one is provided, it either seems to be too simple to accomplish the task
that is normally required of it, or it seems that it was added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was a bit disheartening to find out Python was also in this category.  When
it comes
to built-in support for logging, Python is there with the <code>logging</code> library and its good
set of features.  When it comes to command line parsing, Python is there with the
<code>argparse</code> library and its various helper functions.  When it comes to configuration file
parsing, Python is there with… <code>configparser</code>?  Honestly, I was not impressed.  It
only supports the <code>ini</code> file format and does not seem to have much in the way of useful
support for helper functions that I could find.</p>
<p>So, for this project, I now need to figure out what configuration I need, and how to
properly store it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather that the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please go to this project’s GitHub repository and consult the

<h2 id="what-is-configuration">What Is Configuration?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-configuration" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At face value, configuration is anything that provides information that guides the
execution of the project.  While input information is one class of configuration,
a discussion of that class of configuration is a whole other article unto itself.
As such, I am going to stick to the
two types of configuration that most people think about when they hear configuration:
dynamic configuration and static configuration.</p>
<p>To be honest, I usually take the phrases “data stores” and “dynamic configuration” to mean
the same thing.  This type of configuration is expected to change its configuration
information during the execution of the project.  More often than not, the project itself
is the entity that is changing that information.  This dynamic information can be as
simple as a file that holds the time the project last scanned another data store to a
complete map of the data and relationships for the project. The key point here is that
this information is expected to change often.</p>
<p>The natural complement to dynamic configuration is static configuration.  When most
software developer hear “configuration”, they most often think of things such as
configuration files, environment variables, and command line data.  These items are
all classified as static configuration as they generally do not change once the
execution of the program has started.  Showing a bit of synergy with each other,
if a data store is used to hold information, there is usually one or more static properties
that provide any needed configuration to gain access to that data store.</p>
<p>So, for this article, I am focusing on static configuration and how I added better
support for static configuration to the PyMarkdown project.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-requirements-are-important">Configuration Requirements Are Important<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-requirements-are-important" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Up to this point, the project and its tests have been able to get by without any real hard
requirements for
configuration with respect to this project.  I have a loose set of command line arguments
and a simple map used to configure the plugins, but that is it.
Taking a look at my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2019/12/08/markdown-linter-collecting-requirements/#what-are-the-requirements">initial list of requirements</a>,
there is nothing specifically in there about configuration, just phrases here and there
that somewhat speak of configuration. Phrases like “plans to later add other flavors of
parser” and “extending the base linting rules” that kind of infer that configuration will
be needed, but do not explicitly state its need.</p>
<p>From a design point of view, this was not a failure, but a planned action.  In many
previous projects, I implemented a simple configuration system early in the
project, only to find out that it missed a couple of significant configuration scenarios.
In this case, “missed” means that there was not a straightforward way of representing some
aspect of the configuration in a way that made the most sense.  Given that history, I
decided to go with a minimal configuration approach until I could see what kind of
configuration the project was going to need.</p>
<p>I was glad I took that approach, as it allowed me to properly classify the configuration
into the right category.  For me that classification for configuration deals primarily
with the requirements in 5 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic property support</li>
<li>overriding from the command line or environment</li>
<li>validation</li>
<li>grouping of values</li>
<li>hierarchy and nesting</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how many and which of these requirements are needed defines the type of
configuration that is required.</p>
<p>While there may be more “official” types of static configuration, the ones that I know
about fall into three main types.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-type-1-simple">Configuration Type 1: Simple<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-type-1-simple" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>When people talk about configuration, most often they are talking about simple
configuration.  This is primarily configuration that can easily be put into a file or
passed around in variables, such as environment variables.  From a file-based point of
view, this type of configuration usually looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>host=localhost
port=8080
username=admin
password=admin@123
</pre></div>
<p>Looking for example, a simple Google search turned up
<a href="https://www.journaldev.com/39861/python-read-properties-file">this article</a>
on how to handle properties files in Python using the <code>jproperties</code> library.  This type
is called simple because it is simple, usually implemented with no bells and whistles.  If
the application needs to fetch configuration for the <code>username</code> property, the application
needs to explicitly specify the full name of the property as it appears in the
configuration file. The result is a string that the application must then do any further
changes or validation to before the application can use it.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to this approach.  The pros are easily this type’s simplicity and
the
ability to easily add a layer on top of this configuration that allows overriding these
values from the command line.  Unfortunately, the cons are almost the same,
just for other reasons.  Because this approach is simple, if the application requires any
extra organization or validation for the configuration, the application needs to handle
that code.  As mentioned before, another big con is that with this type of configuration,
everything is a string.  Any interpretation of the data as anything other than a string is
left up to the developer.</p>
<p>Checking in against the list of five requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic property support?  Done.</li>
<li>overriding from the command line or environment?  Extra code required.</li>
<li>validation?  Extra code required.</li>
<li>grouping of values? Extra code required.</li>
<li>hierarchy and nesting? Extra code required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-type-2-grouped">Configuration Type 2: Grouped<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-type-2-grouped" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next step up from the simple type is a grouped type.  While it is a step up from the
simple type, it does not add much.  From a file-based point of view, this type of
configuration usually either looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">host</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">localhost</span>
<span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">8080</span>
<span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">admin</span>
<span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">admin</span><span class="mi">@123</span>
</pre></div>
<p>or like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[Db]</span>
<span class="na">host</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">localhost</span>
<span class="na">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">8080</span>
<span class="na">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">admin</span>
<span class="na">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">admin@123</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As the name of this type suggests, the main thing that this type adds is the ability to
group a collection of configuration items together into a group.  While this may not seem
like a big step forward, it is this type of configuration that I have found to be of most
use in approximately 95% of the projects that I have worked on.</p>
<p>Clarifying that statement, I believe I can successfully demonstrate that 95% of the
projects that I have worked on have used a Grouped type of configuration for any
non-dynamic project configuration.  My choice of words was very deliberate in that previous
statement. While many of those projects had dynamic configuration that was quite complex,
the static configuration for those projects that pointed to the dynamic configuration
artifacts were quite simple.  And while many of those projects started out using the Simple
type of configuration, something always seems to come up that requires the need of
grouping of configuration values on some level.</p>
<p>I do believe that my experiences in this area are common.  Servers?
Most of the time they require some setup of the server and pass any heavy lifting
of information to a data store.  This usually requires two or three small groups of
information, usually with not more than two or three items in each group.  Command line
applications?  Most of the time there was
no data stores and any information was passed in through the command line or environment
variables.  Even if some manner of data store was involved, the configuration only provided
the data to connect to the data store, where the dynamic information was stored.</p>
<p>So, what changes from the previous type?  Only this:</p>
<ul>
<li>grouping of values? Extra code required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next type is where all the big changes occur.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-type-3-complex">Configuration Type 3: Complex<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-type-3-complex" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While this type of configuration is overkill for simple projects, it can be required
for more complex projects, hence its name.  From the main list of configuration items,
there is support for all five, though the support for overriding may be limited due to
the nature of the configuration itself.  When I have encountered a need for this type
of configuration, it has usually been configuration scenarios where there is a strong
need for nesting or hierarchical information.</p>
<p>A good example of this is our standard group of configuration items, this time expressed
using a JSON file for information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">"db"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">"host"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"localhost"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"port"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">8080</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"username"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"admin"</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">"password"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"admin@123"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While this hierarchy could be flattened, expressing it in this form provides meaningful
context to the configuration.  There is no looking for other configuration items throughout
the file that may have the same prefix.  All four of the related items are grouped
together under the <code>db</code> key.  However, a better example of this hierarchical relationship
requires a slight adjustment of the example file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">"db"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">"server"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"host"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"localhost"</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">"database"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"users"</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">"port"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">8080</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="nt">"account"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">"username"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"admin"</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">"password"</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"admin@123"</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With a slight addition of the <code>database</code> field, this file now represents what I feel is
a more logical expression of the configuration items.  While it is true that the previous
group of four items were all related to the database, they were not all related in the
same way.  This organization of the fields presents a more cohesive mapping of what
configuration is required for database access: where the database is and what account to
use.</p>
<p>But as I mentioned at the start of this section, this may be overkill for some
applications.  If all you are storing in the configuration is 10 strings or less, I
would argue that a Grouped or Simple type can more easily be used, with some adjustments
required in the application.  But for other applications with more complex configuration,
this type may be just right for the project.</p>
<h3 id="which-is-best-for-this-project">Which Is Best For This Project?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-is-best-for-this-project" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>After reviewing the different types in my head, I decided that the PyMarkdown project
would benefit from a complex configuration type.  While the base configuration for
the project is basic, I believe that the configuration requirements for any
plugins and extensions will require more complex configuration.  I know that a couple
of the plugins that I want to write for my own website will require lists and possibly
list of maps.  As such, it is better to plan and be prepared, rather than face
a nasty rewrite.</p>
<p>And with that decision, I was on to adding complex configuration support to the
project!</p>
<h2 id="adding-proper-configuration-support">Adding Proper Configuration Support<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-proper-configuration-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having written both low-level and high-level code to work with configuration, I had a
good idea of what to do.  The most important thing for me to do is to make sure
I had any extra requirements for the complex configuration worked out before I
started.</p>
<h3 id="starting-with-base-requirements">Starting With Base Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-with-base-requirements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The base configuration requirement for this project is that it can handle complex
configuration.  Based on that requirement, the most frequently used formats for that
kind of data are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.
Both have their strengths and weaknesses, as the information at those links will
detail.  Having used both of them in previous projects, my feeling was that the JSON
format is simpler format and more direct for users to use.  Because of those reasons,
they made a JSON file a better choice for holding configuration information.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I created a simple class <code>ApplicationProperties</code>
to hold the configuration information.  Keeping any interaction with it simple,
I added a <code>load_from_dict</code> function to take care of transforming a loaded
dictionary into a more convenient form for the class.  After that was place, I
created a simple <code>ApplicationPropertiesJsonLoader</code> class with a straightforward
static function named <code>load_and_set</code>.  This function (and class) was created for
one purpose: to load a JSON file as a dictionary and add it to the provided instance
of the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class.</p>
<p>Class to hold the properties.  Check.  Class to read properties in JSON format and
set to the properties object. Check.  Scenario tests to verify that the loading was
working properly?  Check. Now I needed to figure out the best way to hold
the data within the class and how to access it from the application.</p>
<h3 id="loading-the-configuration-from-a-file">Loading The Configuration From A File<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-the-configuration-from-a-file" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Thinking of the properties “grouping of values” and “hierarchy and nesting”, I had
a decision to make on how to store the data.  To me, that problem had two possible
solutions: keep the dictionary as it was or translate it into a flattened map.  To shape
that decision, I had to keep in mind that one of the reasons that a complex configuration
type is best for this project is due to its extensibility.  Designed correctly, the
configuration for any part of the project would be kept in its own “playground”, free
from interference from any of the other parts.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, I knew that if I kept the dictionary the way it was, I could easily
hand off portions of that dictionary to a subsystem using a single line of code.  However,
if used properly, accessing a property using that dictionary would require multiple
lookups, one for each level of hierarchy required for that property.  The balance to that
was a flattened dictionary, which only every required one lookup.  However, this would
mean that handing off the configuration for a distinct part of the project would not be
as straightforward or inexpensive.</p>
<p>After a fair amount of thought, I decided that the flattened option was the best choice.
It optimized fetching values over hierarchy exclusion, which I believe was the right
choice to make.  Following that decision were three other key decisions.  The first
decision, which might seem like a straightforward decision, was that all keys are
strings.  However, as JSON and other configuration formats can handle non-string
keys, I wanted to be explicit about it.  Secondly, I needed to choose a key separator
character that would determine how to create a path to allow orderly traversal through
configuration.  With many great ones to choose from, I decided to keep it simple and in the
property file family by using the period character <code>.</code>.  Finally, I had to decide about
having all key strings be in upper case or lower case, or to simply have case-sensitive
property keys.  That one was a bit more difficult, but after looking at a few
property files, the answer was obvious: lower case.</p>
<p>With those choices made, I added the <code>__scan_map</code> function and called it from the
<code>load_and_set</code> function.  It was less than 20 minutes before I had the following function
ready to go:</p>

<p>Every key in the dictionary is checked to verify that it is a string
and does not contain the key separator character.  Once the key is verified, if the current
value is a dictionary, the function is called recursively with the current key and
that dictionary.  If it is not a dictionary, it is added to the flattened dictionary by
creating a copy of its value.  When inserted into the dictionary, the key is transformed
into lower case to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>I did try a couple of different options out, but in the end, this simple recursive function
was the clear winner.  I tried to be super-smart about doing the same thing in an
iterative fashion, but it seemed to me to be too much code for such a simple task.  While
I do not have problems with recursive functions in any programming language, I do know that
they can get into runaway mode with one wrong conditional statement.  As such, I verified
the code a couple of times before running it.  I also added the <code>number_of_properties</code>
function and the <code>property_names</code> function before adding more tests to test what I had so
far.</p>
<h3 id="fetching-values-from-the-configuration">Fetching Values From The Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#fetching-values-from-the-configuration" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>With a lot of the tough work behind me, I created some new scenario tests to test
the new function that I was just about to add: the <code>get_property</code> function.  As this
was the start of this function, its coding was very simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_property</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">property_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">property_type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default_value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">property_value</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Basically, unless a valid value is found to replace its value, the <code>property_value</code>
variable is set to <code>default_value</code>.  This made sense to me because it allowed me to
write code that would know if a property was not found, or to just use a default,
whichever solution worked best for the scenario I was working on.  From there, the
function checks to see if the value of <code>property_name</code> is present in the flattened
dictionary and has the specific type that is being looked for.  If both of those
conditions are met, the <code>property_value</code> variable is set to the value found in the
flattened dictionary.</p>
<p>To me, this was just the start, but it was a good, solid, simple start.  Basic
property support was now done… almost. To make things a little easier, I added three
functions:
<code>get_boolean_property</code>, <code>get_integer_property</code>, and <code>get_string_property</code>.  These were
all simple wrappers around the <code>get_property</code> function, providing the appropriate
type information for the third <code>property_type</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Where was I now?  Basic property support. Check.  Grouping of values. Check.
Hierarchy and nesting. Check.  </p>
<p>The next one to tackle?  Validation.</p>
<h3 id="adding-validation">Adding Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-validation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While I do not always need to validate values that I am fetching from configuration,
sometimes it is essential to have.  Where possible, I prefer to assume that the user
is intelligent and will provide intelligent values that make sense. If there is an issue
with the value, I prefer to report that error at a later stage when they are being used,
either directly to the command line or by logging it to a log file.</p>
<p>But in some cases, I need to have some configuration values that I know I can trust on
as they are pivotal to the way the application works.  The easiest one for me to think
of is the <code>log.level</code> configuration value.  As I rely on a solid log file to report
any errors, it is pivotal to me that any changes to the logging behavior are completely
airtight.  Specifically, I only want the log level to be set to one of the known values.
The code to do this for the <code>argparse</code> library and command line handling is relatively
straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">available_log_maps</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The argument is added with a <code>type</code> argument that specifies the <code>log_level_type</code>
function.  This function is called with the provided value as its argument, either
returning that object or raising a <code>ValueError</code>.  The check itself is to simply compare
the argument with the name of one of the keys in the <code>available_log_maps</code>
dictionary.  For me, this is simple, and it seemed like a good pattern to follow.</p>
<p>To start following that pattern, I added the <code>valid_value_fn</code> argument to the
<code>get_property</code> family of functions, defaulting to <code>None.</code>  Once that was done, the other
modification to that function was simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">found_value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">property_type</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">valid_value_fn</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">valid_value_fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">found_value</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">this_exception</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Added right after the type check, if the <code>valid_value_fn</code> is set, the function will
be called to validate the <code>found_value</code>, catching any exceptions that are thrown.
Once again, I looked at a few other options, but simplicity won out again.</p>
<p>But having finished that change, something still was not right.  Something was a bit off.
I was not sure what though.</p>
<h3 id="adding-strict-mode-to-validation">Adding Strict Mode to Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-strict-mode-to-validation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using the log level case as a baseline scenario, I thought through variations on
that scenario and came up short.  There was just something missing that I had not covered
yet.  After a bit of thinking and working through scenarios, it finally came to me:
I needed a strict mode.</p>
<p>There are times where I want a call to the <code>get_property</code> function to return a value
no matter what, but there are other times where I want an exception thrown.  In the
case of fetching the log level, if there is a problem with the value, I want to follow the
<code>argparse</code> example and thrown an exception that halts the application at that point. I
needed something to toggle between this <em>strict</em> behavior and the more relaxed behavior.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, I added the <code>strict_mode</code> argument to the function with a default
of <code>False</code>.  I then added this code snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">found_value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">property_type</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">strict_mode</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"The value for property '{property_name}' must be of type '{property_type.__name__}'."</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">valid_value_fn</span><span class="p">:</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and this code snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">this_exception</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">is_eligible</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">strict_mode</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"The value for property '{property_name}' is not valid: {str(this_exception)}"</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>log.level</code> configuration item as an example, I do not want to default the
log level if it is not a string or is not one of the valid strings.  In those cases,
I want a clear message telling me what the issue is.  For me, this completed the
validation.  I could strictly enforce the validation, request a value from the
configuration file and know it was not fetched (checking <code>default=None</code>), or request
a value and use the default if anything was wrong.</p>
<p>I believe this now covers all the scenarios for validation.  After double checking
that the scenario tests were all up to date and passing cleanly, there were just a couple
of small things left to handle.</p>
<h3 id="almost-there">Almost There<a class="headerlink" href="#almost-there" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Looking at what I had, I believed that the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class was almost there,
but I needed to add two small little things to make it complete.  The first of those
things was a <code>is_required</code>
argument to allow me to state my intention that an argument must be present. That
was followed by code that was added near the end of the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">is_required</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"A value for property '{property_name}' must be provided."</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With that in place, I just wanted to bulletproof the main function <code>get_property</code>.
To do that, I added the following code at the start of the function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">property_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"The propertyName argument must be a string."</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">property_type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"The property_type argument for '{property_name}' must be a type."</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">default_value</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">None</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default_value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">property_type</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">ValueError</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"The default value for property '{property_name}' must either be None or a '{property_type.__name__}' value."</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While this may not be Pythonic, as the types of arguments are being checked, I think it
is necessary.  As a developer, any reliance that I have on low level functions and
libraries requires trust.  I trust that those functions will let me know as quickly as
possible if I mess up.  For me, these parameter checks are just that.</p>
<h2 id="ordering">Ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#ordering" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Out of the initial five items, there was now only one remaining: overriding from the
command line or environment.  While I did not integrate direct support for this into
the <code>ApplicationProeprties</code> class, I did start by setting up a process to follow
for any new configuration items.  This process is simply a “ladder” to follow when
checking configuration values from multiple sources.  That ladder is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>command line</li>
<li>configuration file</li>
<li>default value</li>
</ul>
<p>While I might add code to integrate <code>ApplicationProperties</code> and <code>argparse</code> together
in the future, for right now it was manually done.  Using the <code>log.level</code> item
as an example, the code to properly fetch it was as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">effective_log_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log_level</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log_level</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">effective_log_level</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">effective_log_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__properties</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_string_property</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="s2">"log.level"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">valid_value_fn</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">PyMarkdownLint</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log_level_type</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">effective_log_level</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">effective_log_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_log_level</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This follows the process to the letter.  The first line checks to see if the <code>log_level</code>
field is provided from the command line, either using the present value or setting it
to <code>None</code>.  If that variable is <code>None</code>, then the function uses the <code>get_string_property</code>
function with the <code>log_level_type</code> validator to fetch the log level from the
configuration.  Implied in that call is that if the value is not present, the default
value is <code>None</code>.  Finally, if neither of those actions resulted in assigning the
<code>effective_log_level</code> variable a non-None value, the <code>default_log_level</code> member variable
is used to set a default.</p>
<p>That process is what I want, but it seems a bit long.  Maybe I will see about shortening
it in the future, but for right now, it is exactly what I want.</p>

<p>Finally, before I could finish implementing this in the PyMarkdown project, I needed to
handle the scenario of passing off a subsection of the configuration to a subsystem.
This was important to me because I wanted to make sure that there was absolutely no
chance of overlap between the main application configuration and the configuration of
any plugin.</p>
<p>To do this, I created a new class called <code>ApplicationPropertiesFacade</code> that takes as
arguments the root <code>ApplicationProperties</code> instance and a <code>property_prefix</code> that is
specific to the section to isolate to.  This class is a facade, as the name suggests.
To that extent, this class spends most of its code handing off responsibility for
satisfying the requests by passing on to the root instance with the <code>property_prefix</code>
appended to the start of the key string.  While this may seem simplistic, it gets the
job done remarkably well.</p>
<p>With the work done on this class, its incorporation into the PyMarkdown project, and
all tests passing, it was time to wrap up the work on this item.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I have written many of these types of classes in many languages over the years,
I really am happy about how this one turned out.  The way I know that I am happy about
it as a library-type class is that it does one thing simply but is easily extendable
to do slightly more complex things.  This class does not try and answer for all the
responsibilities of fetching configuration information, it focuses on getting that
information from a file. It is small, it is light, and it accomplishes its goals in what I
believe is a clean manner.  What is there not to like?</p>
<p>But as much as I was confident that I had the right fit for the configuration file,
I now found the command line interface lacking.  I was going to need to take some time
to clean that up.  I was also aware that the initial release is very close now.  There are
two other things in the way of a good first release: cleaning up some important issues and
having a good release story.  I was hoping to fix the first as soon as possible and to
research the second before I needed to start on it.  Here we go!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the <code>ApplicationProperties</code> class coded and working fine, I realize that I needed
to up my game for the command line.  Therefore, the next thing I worked on was the
command line of the project.</p>
