<p>In my
<a href="{filename}/articles/SoftwareQuality/beta-bugs-e.md">last article</a>, I talked
about my continuing efforts to clean up the scenario tests and the existing parser
issues. In this article, I talk about my efforts to bolster the consistency
checks I have built into the project.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>By now, all the low hanging fruit from the Issues List have been picked, preserved,
and stored away. What are left are the more difficult to deal with issues.  Depending
on how one feels about challenges, this is either a good thing or a bad thing.
I choose to interpret it as a good thing.  But I also know that a challenge usually
means more work.
And in the case of getting the PyMarkdown project’s consistency checks working
at full strength, it was going to take a lot of intense debugging work.</p>

<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between

<h2 id="why-do-i-care-about-consistency-checks">Why Do I Care About Consistency Checks?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-i-care-about-consistency-checks" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I started to implement the parser part of the PyMarkdown project, I quickly
came to one unshakeable conclusion: I was undertaking something that would be huge
in scope.  I knew that the 673 examples that came with the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>
specification were only the start of the testing. I figured that those cases would
be most useful in verifying that the correct HTML was being generated, and that verification
would lend some confidence to the parser processing the documents properly.  But
as those examples only include HTML output, I would need to verify the tokenized output
independently of those examples.  And my guess was that the other verification would explode
the number of scenario tests to somewhere over 2500, which is what I thought was a decent
estimate at the time.</p>
<p>To overcome this perceived testing deficiency, I added two levels of checks to
verify the consistency of the parsed Markdown tokens.   The first level of checks,
the Markdown generator, tests the ability to parse from Markdown into a token stream
and back again.  While the presence of container blocks requires extra code to
manage the complexity, this is meant to check prove that that parsing is a relatively
simple bi-directional
process without any loss of information.  The second level check, the position
checker, is a more intense look at the information provided with each token.  Basically,
it specifically focused
on the size of each token and whether the position of the token plus the size
of the token equals the position of the next token.</p>
<p>These two types of checks account for around 95% of the discovered and reported
issues that I have found so far.  And as the easy-to-find issues are mostly gone, it is the
difficult-to-find issues that are now showing up.  Knowing this, I can easily guess
that if any new scenario tests uncover issues, they will probably uncover issues with either nested
List elements or Link Reference Definition elements.  And in the last couple of
months, I believe that only a handful of parser errors have been found, a slightly
larger number of Markdown generation errors, with the position checked having
the most issues.  Put together, there are two problem areas that are well tested
in the parser, but the consistency checks are still finding issues, though mostly
within their own code.  Not perfect, that that knowledge helps.</p>
<p>So why do I care about these consistency checks?  Because they are thorough
in finding issues.  That is, when I do not disable them.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-do-you-disable-them">So… Why Do You Disable Them?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-why-do-you-disable-them" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The truth is that the parser and the Markdown generator are the most stable
components of the project.  Because of its very nature, the position checker is
very precise on where it expects tokens to be positioned.  As such, I have often
disabled the checks with <code>disable_consistency_checks=True</code> when adding a
new feature or fixing an existing issue.  I usually try for between one hour
and three hours to get the checks working, but after the two-hour mark, I go
increasingly with disabling the check.
I honestly admit that this is a bad habit, and one that I am trying to stop following.
But that process does help me from getting stuck, so as with anything, it is not
all bad.</p>
<p>In looking at what I wanted to do this week, I decided to focus on
examining the existing tests with consistency checks disabled<sup id="fnref:pragma"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pragma">1</a></sup>, with a
goal to enable those checks.  Following a search-and-remove of that text from
the scenario tests, I had eighteen tests that I needed to get passing.  And as
I was removing that code, I did notice that the tests were in at least six groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 dealing with HTML Blocks</li>
<li>1 dealing with Paragraphs</li>
<li>1 dealing with Link Reference Definitions</li>
<li>8 dealing with List Blocks</li>
<li>1 dealing with Block Quotes</li>
<li>5 from the “extra” scenario tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with this limited information, I knew that this work would likely take me
the rest of the week to complete.  With at least six distinct groups, it was
highly likely that I was going to look at six or more different areas of the
position checker code and address those issues.  That was going to be time
consuming, as that meant I was going to be looking all over the position checker
code.</p>
<p>As I started fixing issues with the position checker, I was not surprised when
fixing those issues uncovered other errors with the Markdown generator and even
the Markdown parser.  It just made sense to me.  If there was an issue with one
of the two checkers, there was a decent chance that the issue would affect the
other checked.  And with both consistency checks disabled, there was also a decent
chance that a boundary condition failure was being missed.  From my experience,
I had a feeling that once I was able to clear up any issues with the consistency
checkers, I had a high degree of confidence that it would uncover at least two to
three issues in the other components.  After all, that is what those consistency
checks are designed to do.</p>
<p>Finishing the work for
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/87">Issue 87</a>,
the issue I created to contain this work, it took me until right around noon on
Sunday to get everything completed.  I am not in the least bit surprised that it
took that long to complete.  The amount of debugging I did this week was just
immense.  If I had to guess, I probably added as much debug code as non-debug
code, just to be able to follow what was going on in the code.  But the goal was
reached: all eighteen scenario tests are now fully enabled.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey<a class="headerlink" href="#the-journey" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The journey to get there was not an easy one, but it was one that paid off in
the end.  While these are in order of where they were found, the order in
which they were found was all over the place.  In one case, I found three issues
at the same time and had to focus on one before getting to the others.  In my mind,
it was more important to fix things and note how long they took to fix, not the order
in which they were fixed. That, and I arranged my notes by where they were found
and not the order in which they were fixed.</p>
<h3 id="it-just-so-happened-that-this-was-first">It Just So Happened That This Was First<a class="headerlink" href="#it-just-so-happened-that-this-was-first" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Picking one of the tests at random, I settled on test function <code>test_list_blocks_237g</code>.
While I was there for problems with the position checked, I noticed something
almost at once upon looking at the tokenized output for the test: the
Blank Line token was repeated when there was only one Blank Line present in the
Markdown document.  Enabling debug and rerunning the test, it was obvious to see
why.  As far as I could tell, the Blank Line element was being properly processed
within the Block Quote element.  But once that was complete, that same Blank Line
was also being handed off to the Leaf Block Processor where it was processed again,
yielding another Blank Line token.  It was a parser issue!</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, I was able to figure out a quick way to resolve this issue.
The following code was already in place to handle the Blank Line within the
Block Quote element:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">did_blank</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">POGGER</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">debug</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&gt;&gt;already handled blank line. returning."</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">container_level_tokens</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">leaf_tokens</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">container_level_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">this_bq_count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I just made one minor change to that code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">container_level_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">line_to_parse</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">this_bq_count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>as well as other changes to the returns in that function and the functions that
call that function. While it was correctly parsing the Blank Line the first time,
that function was not passing back any information that would allow the second
parsing of the Blank
line to be avoided.  By returning that <code>True</code> from that code, downstream code
was notified that the Blank Line had already been processed, and that it did
not need to continue.</p>
<p>That was one of the easier issues to debug.</p>
<h3 id="double-check-your-output-twice">Double Check Your Output… Twice<a class="headerlink" href="#double-check-your-output-twice" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another test that looked weird when I looked at it was test function
<code>test_extra_007cx</code>.  When I look at a scenario test that is failing, the first
thing that I do is go over the Markdown and the tokens to make sure that I
have familiarity with the content that is being parsed.  As I did that for
this test function, I noticed that trailing whitespace was missing.
After I double checked my initial findings, I did indeed have another parser
issue.  In this case, any whitespace within Text elements within Link elements
was being omitted from the Link token.  Not an easy find, but a good one.</p>
<p>Tracking through the code with the debugger, I came to the <code>__complete_inline_loop</code>
function, where I was firmly convinced the issue was.  Looking through the logs,
the Link token and the encompassed Text token agreed up to this point,
and they diverged after it.  And while it was not much, the space at the end of
the line was present in the Link’s Text element, but not in the Link element
itself.</p>
<p>Doing a bit of experimentation, I added the following code to correct this behavior.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">new_string</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">end_string</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">split_end_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">end_string</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ParserHelper</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">newline_character</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">POGGER</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">debug</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="s2">"split_end_string&gt;&gt;$&gt;&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">split_end_string</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">split_end_string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">new_string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">split_end_string</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">split_end_string</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">new_string</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As the trailing space was present in text block, but not in link element, I knew
that I should not touch the <code>new_string</code> variable, only the <code>new_string_unresolved</code>
variable.  It took a while to get the second <code>if</code> conditional right, adding an
extra scenario test to help tune the code properly.</p>
<p>The interesting part of trying to solve this issue was not the challenge in
fixing the issue itself, that was the easy part.  The interesting part was that
the definition of the issue was tricky and often nuanced.  As I said above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any whitespace within Text elements within Link elements was being omitted from
the Link token</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was easily a boundary case, and a good find.  But not all the solutions were
as easy as these two.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-into-markdown">Transforming Into Markdown<a class="headerlink" href="#transforming-into-markdown" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I was looking for a next scenario test to clean, function <code>test_block_quotes_extra_02ae</code>
and its related scenario tests looked like they were an excellent choice.  At some point
in the resolution work, I noticed that there were four scenario
tests that were failing their consistency checks due to Markdown generation. Before
I spent more time digging deeper into the position check, I felt that my time would
be best spent getting these four functions working properly.</p>
<p>As I examined each of the failing scenario tests, I noticed that they all focused
on one single are: extra whitespace at the start of a Block Quote element line.
There were slightly different variations on this issue, but underneath they all
had the same cause.  Digging into the cause, it was a simple matter to overlapping
data due to nested container elements.  Specifically, in the case of test function
<code>test_block_quotes_extra_02ae</code>, it was the overlapping data of the List element
and the Paragraph element.</p>
<p>During the development of the List elements and the Block Quote elements, I made
some decisions that have affected later work.  The easy decision to explain is the
decision about the Block Quote element.  Looking across all the examples in the
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>
specification, there are a good collection of properly spaced Block Quote characters
and improperly spaced Block Quote characters.  Given that information, I made the
hard choice to include those starting characters in the field <code>leading_spaces</code>
for the Block Quote token that owns that line.  Managing that field and tracking
along with it will parsing and checking has been frustrating, but it still makes
sense to me.  However, because of the more rigorous spacing requirements and a reduced
quantity of improperly indented List element examples, for List tokens I
decided to record their indentation levels in the <code>indent_level</code> and dealing
with any outliers as they surfaced.</p>
<p>Based on the data that I had at the time, I sincerely believe that was the correct
choice to make.  Adding that same <code>leading_spaces</code>  field to the List tokens
would have been too ambitious given the requirements for it.  And whether I liked
it or not, this situation was a direct result of that decision.  But because of
those decisions when this Markdown is parsed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">start</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nv">quote</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>   <span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>the last line gets parsed into a Paragraph token starting with two spaces inside
of a List token with an indent of <code>4</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">extracted_whitespace</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">found_block_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>

<p>It took a bit of time to get there, but finally I arrived at the above code
to mitigate this issue.  Because of the overlap the whitespace in the Paragraph
token and the List indent, this code detects that very circumstance with an existing
Block Quote element and changes the <code>extracted_whitespace</code> variable to reduce
the amount of whitespace.  With a decent amount of testing, this was able to knock
a couple of issues off the list all by itself!</p>
<h2 id="position-checker-woes">Position Checker Woes<a class="headerlink" href="#position-checker-woes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point in the debugging process, I was keenly aware of two things.
The first was that I probably had any existing parser issues and Markdown generator issues
resolved.  While that meant that I needed to be vigilant about my work in getting
the position checker issues resolved, it gave me the confidence to know that I
probably would get most of the serious issues resolved.  At the time and while I was
writing this, I was incredibly careful to think “most” and not “all”.  Issues are tricky
things, and my experience makes me believe that you never get all.</p>
<p>The second thing was that this work was taking a lot of time.  Just for the analysis,
debugging, fixing, and testing of the three prior issues, I was up over twelve hours
in total.  While that included one or two of the issues in this section, the
point was clear.  This was taking a lot of time to get right.  But I still felt
strongly that it needed to get done, so I continued to push forward.</p>
<h3 id="providing-foundational-support">Providing Foundational Support<a class="headerlink" href="#providing-foundational-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most obvious thing that I needed to add was a sense of whether a Block Quote
element was in effect when validating a given set of tokens.  While the actual code
to use it would come later, this code was added in a couple of places, such as in
the <code>__validate_block_token_height</code> function, to calculate that token:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">container_token_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">last_token</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">block_container_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">container_token_index</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">container_token_index</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_start</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">block_container_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">actual_tokens</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">container_token_index</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>While I would normally be more carefully about copy-and-paste code, I already
have plans to revisit the consistency check modules to see about improving them.
As such, this was both quicker and would give me a chance to evaluate some refactoring
tools in the new future.</p>
<p>Along the same path, I added proper support for Block Quotes elements within List
elements in the <code>__maintain_block_stack</code> function. It was not much, but I knew that
I needed to have that value calculated in multiple places. This was providing that support
while adding the necessary code only in a single place.</p>
<h3 id="list-elements-and-block-quote-elements-redux">List Elements and Block Quote Elements - Redux<a class="headerlink" href="#list-elements-and-block-quote-elements-redux" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Like the work detailed in the
<a href="#transforming-into-markdown">Transforming Into Markdown</a> section,
this change to the <code>__validate_new_line</code> function needed to account for Block Quote
tokens and List tokens being used at the same time.  Although the code looks slightly
different, both changes are accomplishing the same goals, just in different ways.
In this function, because of the position checks that go on, the code was a lot
more convoluted and nuanced.  But with a solid group of five scenario tests that
all looked similar:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>FAILED test/test_markdown_block_quotes.py::test_block_quotes_extra_02ae - AssertionError: Line:4:[para(4,5):  ]

<p>it was easy to go through and look for commonalities. It did take a fair amount
of time to get the solution dialed in properly, but it was worth it.</p>
<h3 id="block-quotes-and-blank-lines">Block Quotes and Blank Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#block-quotes-and-blank-lines" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Not yet finished with those tests, I resolved the issue in the previous section,
only for me to be greeted by another issue with those same five scenario tests:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>I had taken care of one issue, only to have another one replace it. I cannot say
that I was surprised because I was not.  This entire week was about things getting
uncovered that also needed fixing.  And like the other issues, this one was
obvious when I looked at it.  When computing the estimated column number for a
Blank Line element, the estimated was sometimes off by two within Block Quote elements.</p>
<p>While this was obviously the problem, the issue with this issue was in defining the
circumstances in which this was the problem.  This code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">container_block_stack</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">current_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">container_block_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_block_quote_start</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">leading_text</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">did_x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">container_block_stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">calculate_next_leading_space_part</span><span class="p">(),</span>
            <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>was obviously being used in all cases, and there was at least one case where it
was being used improperly.  After performing handful of experiments, it turned out that
there were three cases.  The first was if the Blank Line token was followed by
end tokens.  If it was only followed by end tokens, then that recalculation
needs to be applied.  The second was if the “block” of end tokens after the
Blank Line did not include an end List token.  Finally, the block part of
the logic depended on whether the last block token was a Block Quote token
or if the first block token was a Block Quote token.</p>
<p>After about four hours of experimentation and debugging, I arrived at this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">container_block_stack</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">current_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p>It backed up my earlier suspicion that the code was right, just not being used
properly.  It did take a while to nail down the nuances of this code, but it
all made sense then I got there!</p>
<h3 id="second-verse-same-as-the-first">Second Verse, Same as The First<a class="headerlink" href="#second-verse-same-as-the-first" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>And it seems like a continuing theme, having to adjust for Block Quote idents
in various pieces of code, and the changes to the <code>__process_previous_token</code> function
and the <code>__verify_next_inline_handle_previous_end</code> were no different. The change
for the <code>__process_previous_token</code> function was to add this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">block_container_token</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="n">old_line_number</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">estimated_line_number</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and the change to the <code>__verify_next_inline_handle_previous_end</code> function was
to add this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">block_container_token</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">block_container_token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">leading_text_index</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">new_lines</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Both sets of changes are almost identical, except for a couple of slight changes.
But that was always expected, so it was comforting in a way to find these last
two sets of changes to be so alike.  If the triggering condition was met, update
the <code>leading_text_index</code> field, grab the part of the <code>leading_spaces</code> field
relating to the index, and add the length of that value to the current column
number.</p>
<p>And with that, things were clean.  Well, almost.  As I mentioned at least once
in this article, nested container blocks are nuanced.  As such, when I tried to
test something against alternating container blocks that were four levels deep,
I ran into an issue.  While I do want to tackle that as time allows, this work
was about cleaning up disabled consistency checks, not nested blocks.  As such,
left those two tests in the code and disabled them for now.</p>
<p>I must admit that I wanted to deal with them right away, but I knew that I had
enough to do as it was.  Taking that on would just delay things.  I believe
I made the right move in delaying that work, but sometimes it does not feel that
way.</p>
<h2 id="doing-my-usual-cleanup">Doing My Usual Cleanup<a class="headerlink" href="#doing-my-usual-cleanup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I was going through that work, I did notice that there were unusual
cases where I was still using string concatenation instead of f-strings.  While
gearing up for the actual check of the reported issues, I thought it would be
good to go through and clean those up.  While it does not show us as increased
code coverage or increased scenario coverage, it just felt good to get it done
and have everything using f-strings.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-event">The Main Event<a class="headerlink" href="#the-main-event" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, after all this work, there was one more thing to do: The Main Event.
With a solid set of passing tests, with all consistency checks working properly,
I could now start verifying that the Paragraph token’s <code>rehydrate_index</code> field
and the Block Quote token’s <code>leading_text_index</code> field were
working as intended. This was the plan all along, but I had to be sure everything
else was in place before I could start on this.</p>
<p>Working through all the scenario tests listed in the issue, I was able to verify
that any paragraph hydration concerns with those scenario tests had been fixed as
I was unable to reproduce even one failure.  There were now multiple checks to verify
that the <code>rehydrate_index</code> field was being used properly, and all those checks were passing properly.
That was the focus, and after a solid week of work to get there,
I was able to resolve those issues from the Issues List. That was the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news was that the same could not be said for the checks for the <code>leading_text_index</code>
field.  At the end of the <code>__rehydrate_block_quote_end</code> function
was an assert that was commented out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># assert (</span>
<span class="c1">#     leading_text_index == expected_leading_text_index</span>
<span class="c1"># ), f"leading_text_index={str(leading_text_index)};expected_leading_text_index={str(expected_leading_text_index)}"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After two hours of trying to resolve all the issues, I added an issue to the
project’s Issues List and cleaned things up.  What I was able to do however, was
to get it closer to the final state:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">leading_text_index</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">expected_leading_text_index</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">expected_leading_text_index</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">"leading_text_index={leading_text_index};expected_leading_text_index={expected_leading_text_index}"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This uncovered an unnoticed issue in the <code>parse_paragraph</code> function that caused
the parser to emit an extra newline character.  This issue is a weird
boundary condition, and without the above assert, the likelihood of me finding
it was remote at best.  Things must align properly for this to happen,
as the code to detect this condition shows:</p>

<p>And, once again, it took a while to figure it out, but I got there.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes the solution hits you right away, and sometimes you must fight for
every part of that solution. This week, there was a lot of fighting.  While some
of the time it was about the problem and not the solution, most of the time it
was around discovering the nuances of the problem.  And that was challenging, but
the work was exceedingly difficult to focus on.  It required me to keep a level head and to clearly write things
out for myself, so that I could look at the problem from different angles.</p>
<p>And that is what ultimately saved me.  Writing things out.  Yes, lots of scribbles
and pages of weird drawings with arrows and boxes, but it worked.  What I found
useful about my usual practice of using paper to design was that in trying to
figure out the actual problem, I was not establishing a clean visualization of the
problem.  Only when I was able to get enough test data represented in a cohesive
form on those pieces of paper, all visible at the same time, was I able to properly
view the problems and make my breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Now, am I saying that everyone should use paper? Nope.  But for me, the pivotal thing
is that it helps me to visualize things.  It does not matter if it works
for anyone else, but that helps me to visualized.  And the more difficult things
get, the more important it is to find a way to visualize things in a cohesive
manner that is digestible.  For me, that formula is a decent amount of paper scribbles
mixed in with good logging.  That just allows me to keep state and assumptions
on paper while testing them as I go through the log files and recording the actual
changes. As I said at the start of the paragraph, it just must work for me.</p>
<p>So, was it hard? Yes… it was hard.  But I also moved the project forward while
starting to refine another skill to add to my toolbox.  That was unexpected, but
cool!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking ahead in the Issues List, I would like to make more progress on getting
things cleared out.  And with me removing the disabled consistency checks
this past week, I at least want to try and tackle the pragma issues.
Stay tuned!</p>
