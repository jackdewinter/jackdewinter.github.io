<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/11/22/improving-quality-finding-better-tooling-extact-method/">last article</a>, I talked
about my progress in refactoring and my experience with the three added tools. In
this article, I talk about the work I did this week, including the bug that almost
knocked me down for the count!</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>What a long two weeks of work I just had on the <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown">PyMarkdown</a>
project!  I took those two weeks and
invested them wisely in doing some major refactoring on the project.  The project itself was
in decent shape, but I had let some of the functions grow to large and with too many
responsibilities.  For my own sanity and for the project’s own good, I needed to
take some time and get it closer to what I would consider to be a good, healthy
code base.</p>
<p>But that did not mean the work was over.  Not by far.  There were still a couple
of cleanup items that I needed to attend to, plus a list of issues that I found
while doing the refactoring. And while it was nice to take a bit of a break, I
needed to get back to focusing on getting things progressing forward to a non-beta
release soon.</p>

rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in

<p>It will probably not surprise any long-time readers that I decided to take
a small amount of additional time to tidy up some loose ends left after the
work I did in the last two weeks.  Having touched a substantial part of the files
in the project’s core, I wanted
to at least go over the code once and look for anything that I could easily
simplify to make it more maintainable.</p>
<p>There were no tremendous changes, just a lot of little ones.  Things like simplifying:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">coalesced_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="n">coalesced_list</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">first_pass_results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
<p>into:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">coalesced_list</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">first_pass_results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and moving small classes such as the <code>ContainerIndices</code> class into their own modules.
I also double checked the use of return codes from functions to make sure that
they were still being used and removed them if they were not being used.</p>
<p>Other than that, there were cases where I took multiple variable initializations,
such as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">start_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">processed_parts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and condensed them down into:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">start_index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">processed_parts</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Even with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/">Black</a> reformatting such assignments
across multiple lines, I have gradually been moving towards grouping all my
variable initializations together in that manner. I
am not sure if every Python developer feels that it is a good style, but I do.
For me, it clearly states that these variables are being set together and eases
my ability to read the functions.  Basically, it works for me.</p>
<p>But after an evening of going through the source code and cleaning it up,
I knew I had to start making progress on the other issues.</p>
<h2 id="issue-155-refactoring-common-structures"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/155">Issue 155</a> - Refactoring Common Structures<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-155-refactoring-common-structures" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the code base over the last few weeks, I really wanted to be able to
harmonize a few of the
variables that get passed repeatedly into functions.  While there are more examples
of that in the code base than I would like, the ones that I picked to work on for
this ticket were the <code>this_bq_count</code> and <code>stack_bq_count</code> variables.  These are
just one example of variable tuples where two or more variables are usually seen
together.</p>
<p>While not used outside of the Container Block Processor, these two variables are
heavily used inside of the Container Block Processor to capture the current count of
block quotes.  As their names suggest, the <code>this_bq_count</code> variable tracks the
“observed” count of block quote characters and the <code>stack_bq_count</code> variable tracks
the current number of block quote tokens on the stack.  As a Block Quote element
can start and stop on any line, these variables are passed together to ensure
the current state is well known.</p>
<p>At least they were passed together until this work was completed.  When I looked
at the source code for the Container Block Processor, the Block Quote Processor,
and the List Block Processor, there were only five places where these values were
not passed together.  As such, it made sense to add a new class, BlockQuoteData,
and encapsulate those values inside an instance of that class.  It was a bit of
work to move the code to use the new variables, but it did make the code cleaner.
And that means lower maintenance, so that was good!</p>
<h2 id="issue-157-upgrading-test-scripts"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/157">Issue 157</a> - Upgrading Test Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-157-upgrading-test-scripts" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>From experience, depending on how software developers work, they typically either
love typing things out manually on the command line or they love to use scripts.
With my propensity for mistyping
things, otherwise known as “fat-fingering”, I fall into the “love scripts” category.
The PyMarkdown project is a fitting example of how I use scripts to make the simple
development tasks into scripts.</p>
<p>My ability to run Python tests using a script is a example of this practice.
As I do my PyMarkdown work on Windows,
I have a <code>ptest.cmd</code> script that has evolved to have a fair amount of usability,
some of which is the re-used by my <code>clean.cmd</code> script.  But even with the functionality
that it has,
there were times where I could literally go to my kitchen, make a simple sandwich,
eat it, and be back in front of my computer before the script completed.  Granted,
that was running the <code>clean.cmd</code> script with a slowdown for measuring code coverage,
but it was still a long time to wait for a script to complete.</p>
<p>I had looked around and found a couple of PyTest addons that could possibly let
me run the tests on multiple cores, something that would hopefully reduce those
long testing times.  As the upside to finding a workable addon was huge, I took
an evening and experimented with two candidates.  While the first candidate failed
right away, the second candidates looked promising.  After a bit of research on
the issues that I was seeing, I was able to resolve those issues and I added support
for the <code>pytest-xdist</code> package into the project.</p>
<p>I think the reasons that this package works is that it seems to keep things simple,
and it has been around for a while.  By adding the <code>-n !CORES_TO_USE!</code> argument to
where I invoke PyTest in the script, I was able to control how many cores were
used by PyTest on my machine.  Deciding to take a cautious approach, I added the following
code to the script to only use one-half of the available cores for testing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">defined</span> <span class="nv">PTEST_MULTI_CORE_ARGS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="k">set</span> <span class="k">/a</span> <span class="nv">CORES_TO_USE</span><span class="o">=%</span><span class="nv">NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS</span><span class="o">%/</span><span class="mi">2</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">!CORES_TO_USE!</span> <span class="ow">LSS</span> 1 <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">CORES_TO_USE</span><span class="p">=</span>1
    <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">PTEST_MULTI_CORE_ARGS</span><span class="p">=</span>-n <span class="nv">!CORES_TO_USE!</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Digging into the occasional failures I was getting, I added the <code>--dist loadscope</code>
flag as per a suggestion from a reply to a similar question on Stack Exchange. With
the occasional failure not showing up since then, I knew I had a viable solution.</p>
<p>To be open about the entire process, the bulk of the work for these changes was done while I was working
on the previous two issues, so I had a lot of time to experiment with what settings
work best with the way that I work.  That one-half of the available cores was arrived
at because it seemed to be a good balancing point between making my system crawl
and getting a good speed boost for the tests.  Similarly, I added an optional
<code>--maxfail=5</code> to the PyTest command line to better manage the failure cases.  However, as there
is a greater chance that failures will happen in large batches, such as when I
am refactoring, the limit is enabled by default and disabled by using the <code>-a</code> flag.</p>
<p>Based on the refactoring work I did during this last week, this work has been
extremely useful in cutting down test run times.  The time for a full test run with
coverage on my machine went from 7 minutes 32 seconds to 1 minute 35 seconds.
For a nomrmal full run, the duration went from 1 minute 44 seconds to 36 seconds.
Between that and similar tweaks to the other linters, I was happy
with this progress.</p>
<h2 id="issue-93-this-is-that-bug"><a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/93">Issue 93</a> - This Is That Bug<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-93-this-is-that-bug" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, this is the bug that almost knocked me down.  In all honesty, it probably knocked
me down more than a couple of times, I just go back up right away and got back to work.
I do know that at least once
I needed to walk away and collect my cool before getting back to solving the problem.
Basically, resolving this issue was a test of my will to properly fix this issue instead
of doing a partial job.  And it was not always pretty.</p>
<p>Due to commitments at home, I spent the American Thanksgiving holiday at home with my
son.  While we had loose plans to chill out during the holiday weekend, we both had
a lot on our plates and just decided to watch a Champions League game together and
recharge our batteries.  This ended up being useful because of some research that I
had started to do earlier on in the week on
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/93">Issue 93</a>.</p>
<p>In doing my research and playing around with finding a quick solution for this issue,
there was one thing that became at once clear.  Depending on how you look at the
tokens, I either did not have the correct information or I had conflicting information
in the tokens.  Specifically, I was noticing that the whitespace in and around List
elements and Block Quote elements was not being stored in the tokens properly.</p>
<p>The issue was around how this document was parsed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">list</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="n">this</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>    <span class="o">*****</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span> <span class="n">that</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When parsed, the Block Quote token and the List token were both recording the
whitespace associated with the first line.  In particular, the Block Quote token
was storing <code>&gt;{space}</code> and the List token was storing <code>{space}{space}</code>.<sup id="fnref:curlies"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:curlies">1</a></sup>
My original thought was that this decision would be convenient in that the inner
List token would simply “know” that its two space characters were the
greater-than character and the space character from the Block Quote token. When
I was working through that part of the parser, it made sense.</p>
<p>Given time to work on other features, that decision was looking less and less
correct.  There were competing parts of the algorithms that needed their data in
one of two formats, and it was not always clear which format was correct.  On top
of that, the extra work to convert between the two formats was not done consistently
and needed more maintenance than I hoped for.</p>
<p>So, before I did anything else, I needed to make a choice on how to
approach this: pay now or pay later.</p>
<h3 id="the-decision">The Decision<a class="headerlink" href="#the-decision" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Looking at a couple of relatively open days ahead of me, I needed to decide how
to most effectively apply that time to the PyMarkdown project. The one
option was to clear out multiple issues, but only touch the code that I
needed to.  This would incur extra costs in the future, but I could budget those
costs over a couple of weeks.  The other option was to buckle down with the current
time I had and make major progress to getting that work done. That would incur an
immediate expense but would involve less rewriting of code later.</p>
<p>It was not any easy decision for me to make.  I knew that at the very least, I was
talking about eight hours of work.  On the other end of the range, the duration for
that same work could be in the three-to-four-day range.  At that point, it was in
the middle of the day on Thursday, and the prospect  of my entire holiday being
swallowed up was not a good one.</p>
<p>But as I thought about it over the next couple of hours, my mind kept coming back
to two points.  The first point was that this cost was something I was going to
have to pay in the future.  That was not up for debate.  To make the whitespace in
the container tokens more usable, I would need to make changes.  The second point
was about whether I wanted to pay that cost in one large chunk and get it over
with, or incur that cost in smaller chunks, but with interest added on.  The logic
there was that if I chose smaller chunks, not only would I have to pay the main cost
for the changes, but I would have to pay interest on those changes until the main
changes were completed.</p>
<p>With those two points crystalizing as the main differentiators in my decision, the
decision almost made itself.  If I had the time to spend, it would be easier to
do the work in one chunk and avoid the extra work incurred by the spreading that
work out.</p>
<p>And with that… the work started.</p>
<h3 id="just-get-on-with-it">Just Get On With It<a class="headerlink" href="#just-get-on-with-it" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>For my own sanity, I broke the work out into three chunks: getting the scenario tests
passing, getting the Markdown checks passing, and getting the other consistency checks
passing.  It was 11 am Pacific time on Friday morning when I started to make the
changes, and it was after 2pm Pacific time on Sunday when I finished making the changes.
I will not go into all the changes that I had to do, as I would prefer not to try and
relive all that effort.  Do not get me wrong, it was the right thing to do, but it was
just excessively precise work.</p>
<p>The good points were as follows.</p>
<p>The updated tooling effort from earlier in the
week paid off handsomely during this effort.  Most the changes looked good when
I sketched them out in my head, but when I implemented them about half of them,
things changed.  Either
that design did not work as well as I had hoped, or there were nasty side effects
to consider.  By having a quickened “change-test-observed” loop, I could get to
the observed part of the loop that much quicker.  </p>
<p>Having a good set of scenario tests helped me make those changes with confidence.
While I cannot account for tests that I have not added yet, the “test” part of the
“change-test-observed” loop meant that these changes were about going forward and
not introducing more problems. And as I debug best by looking at the overall
picture, having good logging throughout the code base helped me diagnose the
issues and verify the results of the changes.  A good set of tests and 100 percent
code coverage gives me confidence.  But being able to follow the flow
of data through the newly changed portions of the code raises that confidence
even higher.</p>
<p>I was also happy to see that one of the design points of the project, the keeping
the container processing separate from the leaf processing, was still in place.
While fixing this issue properly required substantial work in the Container Block
Processor, only a couple of lines on the boundary between the Container Block
Processor and the Leaf Block Processor needed to be changed.  And I believe most
of those changes were just with logging input values.</p>
<p>And now for the bad points.</p>
<p>Changing the method with which I save whitespaces in container tokens would have
been better made when I was designing the parser.  Doing it at this point was
a nightmare like trying to talk on the phone on the tarmac at a busy airport.
I had to try and keep my focus on what I specifically trying to target.  And
that was not always easy. But while I think I may have been able to design
that part of the system better, I am more convinced that I needed to see the
old design and its flaws to arrive at this improved design.  Sometimes, we need
to take one step backwards to take two steps forward.</p>
<p>The other bad point that I saw is that I think I still have a way to
go in simplifying
the container handling.  These changes were obviously a huge step in the
right direction, but I am sure I can simplify them even more.  It could be
the nature of preserving the whitespace, but I found myself writing code that
was “if in a list block that is in a block quote block”.  In one or two
cases, I believe I had to write something even more devious than that code.</p>
<p>While there may have been other points that I could include here, most were
too minor to mention or on a list of things to look for
when I get free time.  Things like more minor refactorings and patterns to
look out for when writing any new Python code.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the arduous work that I put in, I found it useful to find my balance
between the work I was doing and not letting the weekend slip away
without taking advantage of it.  Similarly, I had to balance those previously
mentioned good points and bad points with what I have carried out with the project.</p>
<p>Yes, there were a couple of times that I yelled “why did I want to write a
linter?” to my computer screen.  If I had chosen to write a Markdown-to-HTML
parser, like <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, then I would be done.
As HTML throws almost all the whitespace away, the parser just needed to
understand the whitespace, not properly store it in a token.  If not for
the fact that I have written a linter and that I wanted to be able to verify
that I had parsed the Markdown properly, I would not need to get the extracted
whitespace <em>exactly</em> correct.</p>
<p>And to me… knowing that I made a hard call, but it was for what I consider
to be the right reasons… that is good enough for me.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having made good inroads to fixing the spacing issues in the parser, I know
I want to find other related issues and see if I can resolve them or easily
resolve them.  But I also would not mind getting some more small refactors
done.  Not sure which is going to win out yet.
Stay tuned!</p>
