<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/11/15/improving-quality-figuring-out-better-tooling/">last article</a>, I talked
about taking a bit of a break and focus on refactoring for a couple of weeks.
Specifically, I talked about the things that I was looking for with respect to more tools to
help with the refactoring.  This week, I talk about the progress that I made with
the refactoring and my experience with the three added tools.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Professionally I am an SDET, otherwise known as a Software Development Engineer
in Test.  When I mention my job title, people often think I am in a company to
test things and break them.  The reality could not be more different.  Most of
what I do is more properly defined as risk management and risk prevention.  A large
part of that is working to find better processes and to find better measurements
for the quality of the projects that I work on.  If I do things properly, I simply present the
information to both teams and their management, helping them make smart
information-based decisions that are keyed to the specific situation that they are in.</p>
<p>From that viewpoint, what I have been doing for the PyMarkdown project is not much
different than my day job.  There are many viewpoints that show risk in any given
project, and it is a tough job to figure out which of those viewpoints to focus
on at any given time.  But even giving myself time to work on the compositional
quality of the PyMarkdown project, I wondered if my usual tools (PyLint and Flake8)
were good enough or if I can do better.  So, as part of my work in the last two
weeks, I picked out three new tools to experiment with, to see if they add any
value to my well-established tool set.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-audience-for-this-article">What Is the Audience for This Article?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-audience-for-this-article" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While detailed more eloquently in
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2020/04/05/what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog/#what-is-the-audience-for-my-blog">this article</a>,
my goal for this technical article is to focus on the reasoning behind my solutions,
rather than the solutions themselves.  For a full record of the solutions presented in
this article, please consult the commits that occurred between
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/397433405008fef9c1ec4c835c1608c473ca51bc">07 Nov 2021</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/commit/5ab751db859c92bd25f3edcc253d71b0b889659f">20 Nov 2021</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-the-playing-field">Setting The Playing Field<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-the-playing-field" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I mentioned in the last article, my usual choice of tools for analyzing
Python projects is the combination of the <a href="https://github.com/pycqa/flake8">Flake8</a>
tool followed by the
<a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint">PyLint</a> tool.  While they do not have information
to help with every refactoring or guideline that I want to use with Python projects,
they do a respectable job in getting me most of the way there.  The question I had asked
myself was whether there were automation tools out there that could help
me to boost the quality even higher than it is.</p>
<p>To that extent, I picked three different tools to try out:
<a href="https://www.code-inspector.com">Code Inspector</a>,
<a href="https://codebeat.co">CodeBeat</a>,
and <a href="https://sourcery.ai">Sourcery</a>.  The minimum qualification for me to use them was that they needed
to have some integration with GitHub that activates when something is pushed to
the repository.  While two of the tools also offer VSCode support, it was not a
requirement.  After all, I run PyLint and Flake8 on the command line and as part
of a lint job using GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>So on to the tools.</p>
<h2 id="code-inspectorcodiga">Code Inspector/Codiga<a class="headerlink" href="#code-inspectorcodiga" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before I started the refactoring last week, I was using a tool called
<a href="https://www.code-inspector.com"><code>Code Inspector</code></a>,
but today I am using the same tool, but now called <code>Codiga</code>.  Some of the URLs
for the tool still point to <code>code-inspector.com</code>, but I expect that they will be
moved over to <code>codiga.io</code> before too long.  And, as far as I can tell, the change
has not affected the usefulness of the tool.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last week, my first impression of this tool was that it would be
useful in helping me keep the number of new PyLint errors down.  Essentially,
as their
<a href="https://doc.codiga.io/docs/faq/#tools">tools page</a>
states, they use specific tools on their platform to scan the projects.  You
can opt in or opt out of scanning your project with any of those tools, so it
is very flexible.  But to be clear, they do not seem to have any custom analysis
tools of their own, only open-source software.</p>
<p>But there is where they shine.  Having used this tool for two weeks, I can
positively say that I am going to continue using this tool going forwards.  Whenever
I make a change to source code in my VSCode editor, the Problems window at the
bottom updates with any <code>Code Inspector</code> information within 10 seconds of me
saving the file.  By having the output in the Problems window with a line
number and column number, I can click on it and go there to fix the issue.
Since <code>Code Inspector</code> is running PyLint as one of its tools, that means
I can find and address any PyLint errors without leaving the editor.  That
is cool!</p>
<p>In addition, their dashboard view of a project is a useful way to see what
is happening with the project.  The dashboard view for the PyMarkdown project
<a href="https://app.codiga.io/project/29635/dashboard">is here</a> and presents some
nice graphs with clickable elements throughout.  During the last two weeks,
the dashboard and the views were immensely helpful in keeping me targeted on the
most impactful changes. And when I want to improve the quality of a given
code base, that is exactly the information that I need.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While this can be considered a repeat of the PyLint and Flake8 tooling,
the in-editor experience and the reporting of those tools supplies enough
of a value-add that I am going to keep on using this.</p>
<h2 id="codebeat">CodeBeat<a class="headerlink" href="#codebeat" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Initially I was optimistic about the <a href="https://codebeat.co">CodeBeat</a> tool,
as it looked promising.  But after
using it for the last two weeks, I am left in a confused state about what
help this tool provides.</p>
<p>When using this tool, it seems to take a while to get my project scanned.
Since I am not paying for this tool, I am okay with that.  But
when I do get a report, the metrics really confuse me.</p>
<p>One of their
metrics, <code>Function too long</code>, is based on the actual number of lines in
the source file, not the number of statements.  As such, after the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/black/">Black</a> formatter has cleaned up my files and placed various function
arguments on their own lines, I find that their
line limit of 30 is breached often.  I get that they are trying to
keep each function on one viewable page within an IDE, but that metric
does not sit right with me.</p>
<p>Then there is the <code>Assignment Branch Condition too high</code> metric.  Brushing up
on the available metrics, I found some valuable information on how to calculate
this metric for Python.  But no matter which function I try it with, the number
that I get is always lower than the one they report in their errors view. And
since they only list the final <code>ABC</code> value, I am unable to check my actual
numbers against their actual numbers.</p>
<p>Finally, from my point of view, the <code>Block Nesting too deep</code> metric is
broken.  This metric is supposed to reflect the maximum number of block nesting
levels in each function. That is not my research, that is
<a href="https://hub.codebeat.co/docs/software-quality-metrics#maximum-block-nesting">their documentation</a>.
But unless my math is off, the depth level that they supply is the total block
nesting depth, not the maximum block nesting depth.  A good example of this is
the following function from the Rule Md027 module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__handle_within_block_quotes_blocks</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_container_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_directly_within_block_quote</span>
<span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_fenced_code_block</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__handle_fenced_code_block</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_container_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_directly_within_block_quote</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_fenced_code_block_end</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__handle_fenced_code_block_end</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_container_tokens</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">is_directly_within_block_quote</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_html_block</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_indented_code_block</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_leaf_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_html_block_end</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_indented_code_block_end</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__last_leaf_token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The block nesting depth reported for this function is <code>4</code>.  I calculate it as
a depth of <code>1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation_1">Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the idea of this tool was nice, I have removed it from the PyMarkdown project.</p>
<h2 id="sourceryai">Sourcery.Ai<a class="headerlink" href="#sourceryai" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>While I had an early idea that <a href="https://sourcery.ai">Sourcery</a> would be useful,
it was not until I
started using it for refactoring that I was able to find out how useful it
was.  From the usability point of view, it was always spot on with what it
found and suggestions on how to make it better.  Looking at the list
of <a href="https://docs.sourcery.ai/refactorings/">possible refactorings</a>, I believe
that I have hit about maybe 25% of the refactorings presented.</p>
<p>Some of those refactorings were easy ones that I had missed.  Others
were making the code more readable by doing things like applying the De Morgan
Identity to a conditional expression.  Now, I have been doing that refactoring
for years, but I always must write it out and manually work through the arguments
of the expression, just to make sure that I get it right.  With Sourcery, I just
clicked on the apply refactoring menu item, and it was one for me.  It was the
same thing with applying their “Convert to Enumerate” rule. I could easily do it
for myself, but I was always concerned that I was going to fat-finger something
and break the code. This was a lot easier and a lot less error prone.</p>
<p>Those features alone would have sold me on using this as a tool.  And then I
ran into a couple of refactorings such as “List comprehension”.  To be totally
open, I struggle with comprehensions.  I have tried three times to make
some serious pushes into learning comprehensions, but I have struggled each
time.  I think that the
<a href="https://docs.sourcery.ai/refactorings/list-comprehension/">List Comprehension</a>
might be the thing that helps me make progress on learning comprehensions.</p>
<p>Why do I say that?  Well, there is the obvious fact that Sourcery detected
a series of statements that can more compactly and efficiently represented using
a comprehension.  I know I sometimes have issues with just that.  Then there
is the ability to translate it with a press of a button.  For me, that is a
teaching moment.  Being able to see that something can be changed, and having
that change being applied gets through to me more than any amount of reading
can do.  And it works even better if it is something I am familiar with and
not a made-up example.  I think it is safe to say, it just hits home in a
new way for me.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation_2">Evaluation<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Basically, if I had to assign a role to Sourcery and how it helped
me with the PyMarkdown project, it would be role of mentor.  It was not the
role I assign to PyLint and Flake8, which is essentially a monitor role.
Besides, that role is solidly filled by the existing tools PyLint and
Flake8.  Sourcery provides
me with better ways to do things, providing me with solid information on how
things would look after that change, how to make that change, and why it
should be changed.</p>
<p>And as I can always use a good nudge in the direction of cleaner code, this
is a tool that I want to keep in my toolbox.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention this other nifty feature?  If I forget to apply a
suggested refactoring, Sourcery creates a new PR with their suggested changes
already applied, ready to merge into a newly committed branch at my command.
While I am not usually forgetful when it comes to process, it is nice to
know that Sourcery has my back!</p>
<h2 id="choosing-a-quality-measurement">Choosing a Quality Measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-quality-measurement" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having experimented with the Sourcery’s Quality measure for a function, I was
pleased that its measurement of quality was mostly coordinated with my own observations.
To be clear from the start, I do not have any plans to stipulate that all of the functions
in the PyMarkdown project to have a Quality measure in the 70s or higher.  While
it might be nice to get there on smaller projects, I do not believe that achieving
that measurement on larger projects such as PyMarkdown are achievable.  And
even if they are achievable, I believe that the breakdown of the functions to
achieve that measure would trash the readability of each function.</p>
<p>But looking through their reports, I had to come up with a quality score that I
at least thought was a good target for an initial push to clean up the project.
I found the one boundary of 25 to be too low and needed all the functions in
the project to be higher than that.  Experimenting with a couple of functions
and what their Quality score were, I decided that a score of 40 was a good
starting point.  Why 40?  I just found it to be a satisfactory level of quality without
being too disruptive to the readability of the project.</p>
<h2 id="refactor-extract-method">Refactor: Extract Method<a class="headerlink" href="#refactor-extract-method" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having picked a minimum quality score of 40 for each function, I started working
my way through the PyMarkdown project, one module at a time.  The process of
going through the entire project was long and arduous, taking the better part
of two complete weeks.  The process was also very monotonous, as it was always
the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check through the next module, examining the reported Quality for each function.</li>
<li>Find the next lowest code quality function in the current module.</li>
<li>If the quality for that function is 40 or above, go to Step 1.</li>
<li>Otherwise, examine the function and Find a good block of code to extract.</li>
<li>Add a marker function call with the name of the new function.</li>
<li>Create a new function and extract the code to that new function.</li>
<li>Add arguments to the new function to satisfy any missing variables from the function.</li>
<li>Copy that argument list and add it to the marker function’s argument list.</li>
<li>Go through all assignments from the function and add them to the list of variables to be returned by the function.</li>
<li>Copy that return variable list to the marker function.</li>
<li>Use VSCode to figure out which variables are not used by the original function and remove those variables from both lists.</li>
<li>Run the full set of <code>PyTest</code> tests, looking for any asserts that show something is wrong.</li>
<li>If something is wrong, fix it.  If it cannot be fixed, revert the file and start over.<ul>
<li>The most likely thing that happened to me was that a variable was not assigned before usage.
  This happened with variables that were assigned in optional code blocks.  The fix was to make
  sure to add default values before the optional code block to ensure that variable was set to something reasonable.</li>
<li>In some cases, I entered the wrong code, and I just got either a syntax error or a test failure.
  In those cases, reverting the file was the easiest way to go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verify that it looks right, and stage that change to the repository, so it does not get lost.</li>
<li>Look at the new quality score for the function.  If it is below 40%, go to Step 4. Otherwise go to Step 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as the PyMarkdown project was concerned, that was my life for two weeks.
It was not overly exciting, but it was rewarding.  Even as I was making my way through
the modules, I could see that the readability of the modules was already increasing.
I could be wrong, but I believe there is only one place in the refactored code where
I simply added a number to the end of an extracted method.  In all other cases, I
was able to find a solid, logically place for the function to be split up.</p>

<p>One thing that Codiga listed in its Violations view were the number of <code># TODO</code>
comments that I had littered around the PyMarkdown project code base.  While I
did not initially agree with their definition of these comments as violations,
I started to come around quickly.  Deciding to get them out of the way,
I spent Saturday afternoon going through most of the TODO comments.  In each
case, I either removed the comment, fixed the issue and removed the comment,
or logged a new issue and removed the comment.  When all was said and done,
the comments for <a href="https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown/issues/145">Issue 145</a>
detailed each of the TODO comments and what was done with it.</p>
<p>To be honest, there were an equal amount of “what the F***?” comments as there
were “didn’t I already…?” comments.  Then there were the “yeah, I should have
done this long ago” comments.</p>
<p>Basically, it was good to just get these things done, figured out, or removed
from the code base.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-experience-so-far">What Was My Experience So Far?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-was-my-experience-so-far" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reason that I decided to write a linter in Python is that I wanted to learn
Python and this was an excellent project to do that with.  The reason I chose
a Markdown linter is because I did not feel there was a good, flexible linter
for Markdown out there.  Specifically, I picked a linter because linters help
developers look within their content to see if there is something that they can
do to be more consistent and to raise the quality of their content.</p>
<p>And that is what I like about the PyMarkdown project.  I am still learning about
Python and I know I have a solid set of rules that can help Markdown document
authors.  Additionally, I know I can write more rules to help those same
authors apply extra structure to their documents.</p>
<p>That is why, even through the boring refactoring effort, I kept on going.  Because I
knew that this work was helping me to help myself, and to help others. As
altruistic as it sounds, that is enough for me.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>I still have a couple of smaller items to clean up, but the big refactoring work
has been completed.  I do want to make more progress on bugs, so I will probably
split my time between those two efforts.
Stay tuned!</p>
