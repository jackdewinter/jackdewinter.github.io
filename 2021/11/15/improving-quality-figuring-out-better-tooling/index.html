<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>In my
<a href="https://jackdewinter.github.io/2021/11/08/markdown-linter-fun-with-block-quotes/">last article</a>, I talked
about my desire to focus on Nested Container blocks.  After a long hard push
to get to this point in the PyMarkdown project, I decided to take a bit of a
break and focus on refactoring for a couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>After deciding to take a bit of time off to focus on not fixing issues, I decided
that refactoring the codebase was an effective way to stay connected to the PyMarkdown
project while taking a more relaxed approach to work.  I have been aware for some
time that refactoring that needed to be done, it just was never a priority to work
on that part of the project.  As I try to give my best for every part of every
project that I work on, I decided that I needed to make the time, and that now
was that time.</p>
<h2 id="why-take-time-now-to-refactor">Why Take Time Now To Refactor?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-take-time-now-to-refactor" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The truth?  I was tired of fixing issues and having more issues waiting
for me to fix.  I am under no illusion that I need to get back to fixing the remaining
issues, but I decided that I needed a break from the issue resolution process.
I know it might seem weird, but choosing to focus on improving the quality of
the PyMarkdown project is relaxing to me. And when it came down to it, I knew
that the right thing for me to do at this point was take time to focus on
something else for a couple of weeks.  I need to make sure that I have the drive
and energy to enable me to reach the finish line on the remaining issues.</p>
<p>And it was not like the project was desperately in need of refactoring, so I am
confident that it is a relatively relaxing task that I am undertaking. When developing
the PyMarkdown project, I undertook most of the small refactors as I was
developing the code itself.  If I have developed the project according to this
belief, hopefully I just have the larger, more complicated refactorings to
complete.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-improving-quality">What Do I Mean By Improving Quality?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-i-mean-by-improving-quality" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous ways to refactor code.  For each of those ways, there are
recipes that can be followed to improve the quality of the code.  But before
the quality can be improved, there are two things that greatly enhance the
success of improving the quality of the code: solid tests and good metrics.</p>
<p>The more complete the testing of a given codebase is, the more confidence that
I have that a given refactoring will not negatively affect that codebase. When
it comes down to it, the reason for that confidence is a simple one.  Codebases
are complex entities where all the side effects of changing a given line of
code may not be easily known.  Each test helps increase the level of
monitoring of that codebase for any unwanted side effects.  With the right
monitoring in place,
changes can be more confidently made with more certainty that the change is
creating a positive change, not a negative one.</p>
<p>Good metrics are needed because of a simple reason:
not every piece of code requires refactoring.  Code only needs to be refactored
if there are warning signs that are clear using tools specifically
designed to look for a sampling of those warning signs.  For the PyMarkdown
project, I have used the <a href="https://github.com/pycqa/flake8">flake8</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint">pylint</a> tools to look for obvious
issues as I write the code.  With very few exceptions, if Flake8 reports an
issue, I fix it before checking in code.  For PyLint, I try and fix the issue
if it is one of the simpler issues to fix.  If the issue is one of <code>too-many-locals</code>,
<code>too-many-branches</code>, or <code>too-many-statements</code>, I often delay fixing the issue
until later.  This helps me stay creative, fixing the issue that I am working on.</p>
<p>But as soon as the bulk of the creativity is order, that is when my focus on
quality takes over.  Creativity helps me get near to the finish line, but
I know that my focus on quality and solid testing is what gets me over the
finish line. Relating it to the woodworking that I do, the creativity is
what gets the item built. But it is the quality that makes the item usable
and attractive to others.  You cannot have just one of them, you need them
both working together to cross that finish line.</p>
<h2 id="what-tools-should-i-use">What Tools Should I Use?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-tools-should-i-use" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Deciding that I
wanted to have a better picture of what PyLint suppressions I have added to
the PyMarkdown project, I created a small Python script to help me out with that
analysis.  It extracts that information from a project on a module-by-module
basis, as well as a convenient cross-project total, and saves that information
to a JSON file of my choosing.  With that information in hand, I have the start
of some good metrics on how I can improve the quality.  But I often wondered if there
were other tools that would supply additional benefits with useful metrics.</p>
<p>To that extent, I started looking for potential candidates.  The first
qualification is that the tool must be free for Open Source Projects. The second
qualification is that it must provide one or more added metrics that help
me to find issues with the PyMarkdown project.  Finally, the third qualification
is that the tool must be decently usable.  While that third qualification is
more intangible than the others, it is an important one.</p>
<p>Following those guidelines, I found three potential candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codebeat.co/">CodeBeat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.code-inspector.com/">Code Inspector</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourcery.ai/">Sourcery</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these tools provide for simple installation into the GitHub workflow
of the PyMarkdown project, so they are on equal footing there.  Both Sourcery
and Code Inspector have VSCode plugins, so they both gets extra marks there.
That is where things start to differ.</p>
<h3 id="codebeat">CodeBeat<a class="headerlink" href="#codebeat" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>CodeBeat is a tool that provides each repository with a GPA score, outlining how
each part of the repository contributes to that score.  Looking like a high school
report card, each module can be clicked on to discover how that module’s score
was calculated.  One of the benefits of CodeBeat is that it is a cross-platform
tool, supporting 20+ different languages, of which Python is just one.</p>
<p>I can only investigate the metrics that are reported for the PyMarkdown project,
as there is no information on their web page about what metrics are calculated
and with which tools.  Based on the metrics that I see, there are only two
possible metrics that may be useful, Block Nesting and ABC.</p>
<h4 id="block-nesting-level">Block Nesting Level<a class="headerlink" href="#block-nesting-level" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Block nesting is meant to calculate the maximum number of distinct indentation
levels that are applied to a given function. Given this example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">next_token</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_blank_line</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__have_incremented_for_this_line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>the block nesting level should be calculated as <code>1</code> due to the single indentation
level that occurs on the fourth line of the function.  Similarly, the following
example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_end_token</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="c1"># do something here</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">some_condition</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__have_incremented_for_this_line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>has a block nesting level of <code>2</code>.  Nicknamed the
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrowAntiPattern">Arrowhead Anti-pattern</a>, anything beyond
three nested levels is considered to follow this anti-pattern, decreasing
comprehension, and making it difficult to support.</p>
<p>While interesting, there are two problems with this metrics.  The first is that
a rule for this metric is already present in PyLint as <code>too-many-nested-blocks</code>,
though with a
default value of <code>5</code>.  The second is that this tool reports the total number
of distinct indents, not the maximum indent.  Due to both, this metric
is not an option for me to use.</p>
<h4 id="assignment-branch-condition">Assignment Branch Condition<a class="headerlink" href="#assignment-branch-condition" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The other possible metric is the “Assignment Branch Condition” or ABC metric.
With a more complete description of the
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AbcMetric">metric here</a>,
the basic idea is to calculate the magnitude of the elements for those three
classes of elements in the functions.  Using the last example, there is one
assignment on line 6, two branches on lines 1 and 5, and zero conditions.
Therefore, the ABC value for that example is the square root of <code>1*1 + 2*2 + 0*0</code>
or the square root of five.</p>
<p>My issue with this metric is that its accuracy is very dependent on how the
calculation is applied to the function being evaluated.  This rule only reports
errors when the (unconfigurable) limit of <code>10</code> is exceeded, without showing any
indication of how the triggering value was arrived at.  Based on that lack of
information, I do not find this metric to be actionable, as it is difficult
to figure out what to try and optimize for in the triggered code.</p>
<h4 id="where-does-that-leave-me">Where Does That Leave Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-does-that-leave-me" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Things are not looking good for this tool with respect to the PyMarkdown
project and its needs.  It may be that this this tool benefits projects
that are not using PyLint and Flake8, but that is not the case for this project.
That means that for me, this at best is a curiosity.</p>
<h3 id="code-inspector">Code Inspector<a class="headerlink" href="#code-inspector" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Code Inspector is a tool that supplies a high-level categorization of the issues
that it finds, something that is useful. Another cross-platform solution,
this tool benefits from a decently responsive VSCode extension.</p>
<p>There are multiple things that this tool brings to the table.  The first is that
it is decent at discovering duplicated code.  There seems to be a five- or six-line
threshold for detecting those duplicates, but that seems reasonable.
Other than that, this tool relies on PyLint and Bandit for Python analysis.  Bandit
is a decent tool that adds security checking to the suite of tools being applied
against the
project.  As the PyMarkdown project is an application with very few, if any,
security concerns, adding Bandit to the mix does not help.</p>
<p>However, one thing that should not be overlooked is that the Code Inspector
VSCode extension allows for PyLint to be executed against the codebase with
every save.  This has proven invaluable so far for being able to assess changes
to see if there are any negative consequences of that change.  While I am
currently using their Basic package which is free, there is a noticeable 10 to
30 second delay between when I save a Python file and when the scan information
is updated.  But since I am not paying anything for their service, I am
okay with that.</p>
<h4 id="where-does-that-leave-me_1">Where Does That Leave Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-does-that-leave-me_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>While the tool itself does not add any useful metrics that I can use, it does
execute PyLint with each save, which is useful to me.  Having the information
there as I am making the changes is unbelievably valuable.</p>
<h3 id="sourcery">Sourcery<a class="headerlink" href="#sourcery" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sourcery is a Python only tool that integrated directly into the GitHub action
process and into VSCode as an extension.  Because of the focus on Python and the
integration with VSCode, Sourcery can not only find issues but suggest fixes to
issues that it finds.  For a full list of suggested refactorings, look at
<a href="https://docs.sourcery.ai/refactorings/">this web page</a>.  The list is long and
substantial.</p>
<p>Two other parts of this tool really appeal to me and the way I develop in Python.
The first is that the duplicate analysis in Sourcery is decent.  While not as
powerful as in the paid versions, the free version has decent pattern
matching for detecting duplicates.  The second part that appeals to me is the
code quality percentage metric.  It is very clearly explained and broken down
into its components parts when displayed.  That breakdown helped me figure out
how to best address the issue.</p>
<p>Next up is the email it sends out with every Pull Request with the same information
on where things were before the Pull Request and where they will be after the Pull
Request.  I know that it might appear to be duplication, but I find it nice to
be able to go over what I did the day before and see how any commits affected the
quality of the project.</p>
<p>The final part of this tool that I like is the Pull Request that is created for me
with any suggested refactorings based on my last commit.
Just to be clear, I did not add anything or turn anything on to enable that feature.
That is a stock option for this tool.  For me, that is an extremely useful feature to
have.  While I may decide to not include that Pull Request for assorted reasons,
if I do decide to approve the Pull Request, it has already started to pass any
tests or metrics that I use for a normal Pull Request.  And if nothing else,
if my own Pull Request gets a clean bill of health from Sourcery, I know that
I have solid code in that Pull Request.</p>
<h4 id="where-does-that-leave-me_2">Where Does That Leave Me?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-does-that-leave-me_2" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>While I have been developing software for decades now, I am still learning
when it comes to Python.  Even if I was not learning the ropes, I
know that I do not always follow best practices.  Sourcery is a great tool for
keeping me honest and for helping me to refine my understanding of Python.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is Next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-next" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Well, it is not my usual ending, but it is an ending… kind of.  I am going to
continue using these tools for another week while I see if there are any other
features that show up during my refactoring.  I know I am leaning heavily on
Sourcery to augment my knowledge of Python and Code Inspector to help with
executing PyLint as I developer, but things may change!  Stay tuned!</p>
